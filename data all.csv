"Hotel with proper hygiene to protect against COVID-19 Staff and trainee are friendly. Great taste of breakfast and very delicious rice bowl. Bed is comfortable and comfy. - Services from the team members are excellent, especially at the restaurant. Pool and angkringan are very joyful."
"We went (the whole family) for a vacation in Yogyakarta. There are many hotels to choose. Decided to stay in Hyatt Regency because of the location initially, but experiences that we got are more than what we expected, especially the facilities."
"When i decided to stay here, I know its interior is dated, need renovation. But I still like to stay here in the future, because this hotel has very good staff, and has one of the best outdoor facility in this city. "
"Good view and very nice swimming pool area, you can walk at the jogging track and enjoy the cool air among the trees,   Good traditional food like getuk, nice staff and good service,   You can found your peace at Hyatt Jogja.  Will be back again when visit jogja   See you soon"
"This hotel is very nice, especially its outdoor facilities like jogging track, bike rental and swimming pool. We can enjoy a beautiful views of a well managed garden and golf course with Merapi Mountain as a background. "
"the best service, hotel staff was very nice, escorted from the front desk to the door of the room, detailed explanation of the facilities, comfort and cleanliness that are guaranteed during a pandemic"
"the service at hyatt regency is very good, the hotel is also good, especially the large swimming pool and its golf court. I offered to upgrade to a club house and get a good complimentary. Quite worthed for those who like to enjoy cocktails in the afternoon. Overall the service at this hotel is very good especially the restaurant."
"The experience of staying at the Hotel Hyatt Jogja will be a pleasant moment. The atmosphere is comfortable and close to the city of Yogyakarta. Large green space, golf course, swimming pool, and more. I love cycling in the morning around the green route. Get the fresh air and oxygen and the lush green views."
"We had a wonderful stay in Hyatt Yogyakarta as we made 2 days in a beautiful surroundings including golf view , beautiful and huge pool , tennis court and grab wheel. My kids enjoyed all  those facilities and their favorite have been the tarzan rope at the pool. We will be back"
"Rooms are getting dated, but facilities were great. Guest recovery service was not good as I did not receive anything except apology for the keycard being programmed wrongly twice. Besides front desk, other department services were great!"
"So many activities for kids on vacation, it‚Äôs very interesting; bicycle riding, mini golf, swimming pool, and hot stone lobster is good. The room hotel a little bit old, but the maintenance is good. thanks for your hospitality."
"i stay in this hotel when i visit yogya. the reason is my daughter love the swimming pool. the swimming pool is large and have a long slide. the balcony have a nice view, you can also ride a bicyle and scooter at the jogging track "
Big  outdoor area with various family activities  perfect for bringing family in new normal era. The children love the pool and games activity and rental schooter. There also bike for free to be used for 3 hours.
"I have no complaint to the hotel‚Äôs facilities. It is surrounded by a huge green garden and they offer some activities. Restaurants have good food (only tried bogeys and kemangi), staff are very helpful and responsive, room ammenities are complete.   My 3 stars ratings is due to the very old condition of the room. It needs major upgrade. Room phone is broken, TV remote is broken as well... sofa has seen a better days, bed is still okay but the 2 out of 4 pillows are lumpy, furnitures are worn... Mind you I stayed only at deluxe room, so maybe in higher room classes the condition is better..."
Very clean over all satysfy thx u üôè Very kindly all staff make me and family happy .... very helpful mybe next i request have to choice type of room not just available thankyouu  Breakfast have many menu of local food
"When checking in I was told that my room was upgraded especially because I was a guest who had several experiences staying at the Hyatt Jogja. The hotel distributed free hand sanitizers and masks to guests. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Room installed sanitary stickers. The food and drinks at breakfast are quite varied, the food and drinks that I ordered in the room also tasted ok. The facilities are very complete with a wide landscape and great view (golf course, playground, grab wheel, swimming pool, etc), suitable for family vacation with children. In generally I‚Äôm satisfied stay at the Hyatt. "
"All the staffs is very kind and friedly. They always smile and helpful.  But the check in process took a long time. It was more than 15 minutes. Then, we had to wait 20 minutes more because the room would not ready until 15.00."
"Overall meet expectation,, althought in pandemic moment we can still have actitfities in public area without worry because Hyatt runs the covid protocol. For example for breakfast time, no selfservice but servered."
"Overall service, cleanliness, room, etc is very good. but i‚Äôve a bad experience with the housekeeping staff. after the room was cleaned was not given new slippers for my room.  by the time i asked for new slippers, i had to wait almost an hour"
"Definitely back again soon, everything is good. This hotel is very family friendly with large pool and large garden. The room is very clean and the amenities are complete, they even provide ironing board in each room. "
"It has a good health protocol during this covid 19 pandemic. It makes me feel safe during stay here. It&#39;s nice to spending my time with my family here.It&#39;s clean, tidy and friendly staff.It&#39;s recommended :) Thank you"
"The room is too old. The swimming pool is slippery (need to be cleaned), the gym and sauna are too old (looks dirty). The hotel hosts 2 weddings and dog show during my stay. I would appreciate if they warn the guests that they would host such big events during covid period."
"The staff is friendly and helpfull, i really love the view, the bathroom.  I enjoy my stay here. While me and my sisters are having bridal shower in the room, it was fun. We ask a lot of help through the telephone to Receptionist, and they answer very well"
"Great Hotel with very nice environment, we can view of mount Merapi from the lobby. Service was excellent and ease of check in and check out, food was good and many activities that we can join including cycling in the morning"
"The staffs, the room, the ambience, the foods, everything was great. Hyatt gives me the best stay experience during this crazy time. I really enjoy the stay. Certainly will come back to stay at Hyatt Regency when I come to Jogja."
"The hotel just the same like picture. Breathtaking view on the landscape. Hotel looks old but still very well maintained. Everything was function perfectly. Bed and pillow was very comfortable, even the extra bed too! We had a good sleep there and really enjoyed the facilities especially the swimming pool. Staffs are very nice, breakfast are delicious eventhough we were quite surprise that the varieties were not as much as regular buffet but we can understand that maybe during this covid time they try to manage simple breakfast but still with health protocols way. But there was one thing is quite dissapointed that we found a glass in our room was still dirty. The coffee stain still there. But overall it was a great experience staying there and will go back for sure. For those</span><span>&hellip;"
"Beautiful view completed with golf course, perfect for honeymoon, and the staffs really care your needs. Especially a trainee named Reza, he helped me a lot. Also, the staff gave us beautiful flowers arrangments and a surprise gift when I checked out."
"Excellent services, very clean room and also already complied with the health protocol (with respect to the covid 19 protocol). We absolutely enjoy. We also like the location of this hotel. Overall excellent."
"3 stars is a little generous and it was the amazing staff, nice pool, and decent food that saved the review for this hotel. The rooms are very outdated and somewhat musty. I asked the staff and they said it had been 20 years since they have been renovated and it shows. The only thing worse than the rooms is the fitness center. Really just a small room with dingy carpet, two older treadmills and a few outdated weights. "
"We were staying at this hotel with my 2 daughters, and took 2 rooms at regency club. Unfortunately, the hot water was not good, seems need to be improved. The bed is need to be changed (quiet old I guess), and bed linen as well. We were enjoying the breakfast, overall the menu was good. "
"A great big hotel in the middle of the city. The condition of the hotel quite old, but in good maintenance care. Our family experiencing a good staycation in a good environment, a big green environment around the hotel"
"I came here for my intimate wedding party, stay here for 2 night with family. They love their rooms, and the foodis delicious. Everyone are kind and helpful, i would love to come here for another occasion. Thankyou!"
"I didn&#39;t expect too much before, but facilities at Hyatt Regency are very sastifying us, i hope can stay at Hyatt again soon. I enjoyed swimming at the pool, riding bicycle, and also i enjoyed the Vibes and the room"
"Very good experience of &quot;staycation&quot;. During this pandemic era, the hospitality and overall services maintained a best quality approach. Warm welcome, kids and family friendly. A lot of laughter and happiness. Many thanks, Hyatt Regency Yogya. We&#39;ll be back.. "
"Perfect choice for those who want to enjoy stay in beautiful hotel with nature surrounding. I enjoyed my 3 nights stay with whole family, babies and kid. The staffs were very friendly and helpful accomodate our needs. Swimming pools were awesome. I will definitely come back."
"Almost 3 weeks 13 Oct - 28 Oct I have been stayed in Hyatt Regency. The most i love in this Hotel is the food. Set menu is surprising me, Indonesian taste, I love it. For Hotel facilities, there is Golf Course, Swimming Pool, Jogging Track, Gym, Bike, and mini Bar."
"Actually, this is not my first time staying here. and it&#39;s satisfying as always. nice and helpful staff. beautiful view. it&#39;s an old building hotel but the service is gold. so it&#39;s worth to stay here for vacation. thank you "
The hotel is family friendly and have a peaceful athmosphere. The pools are best. Choose the outdoor area to have your breakfast and you&#39;ll have a sensation having breakfast under the trees and poolside. However they only provide very limited menu variance for breakfast. We had the same menu when we stayed for 4 days! We also found that the closet in our room was clogged and we also need to ask for a doormat in the bathroom as they provide it only on the first day of our stay.
"The hotel facilities are really excellent. The food offer is convenient and appropriate for western travellers wanting to have variations beyond delicious Indonesia Food. There is a 9 hole golf course surrounding the hotel. The pool is absolutely beautiful, with many nice corners, that provides you alternatives for sun or shade, being grouped with friends, or isolated."
Its very nice to make happy my moms in the beautiful place for taking rest and having fun at yogya...swimming and relaxing in hot pool...its became good memory for our quality time with my moms and my sisters
"I love the room, good breakfast, have a nice facilities, great views. the staff are friendly &amp; warm. Unfortunately due to low occupancy during the pandemic, they limit the hot water for shower, I understand they have to do it to safe their opex "
"The largest hotel in Yogyakarta with open space. You can do a lot of out door activites, such as golfing, jogging, feeding fish, play with turtles, fishing and lot of more Great experience with strict health protocol to keep us safe. Will come again in the future. :)"
"Ithe hotel has a very large area, include a golf field at the back, the landscape is green full of trees,garden and pools, complete facilities, very suitable for family with kids, business meeting and leisure. I love it and surely will come back again"
"The hotel is close to several decent eateries such as Ikan Bakar Cianjur, nasi uduk palagan and Iga sapi bali.  The hotel is side by side with golf court, despite being nearby Palagan which is rather crowded and bustling, it feels like in a different secluded peaceful region.  Great huge swimming pool, gym available 24hours, fish pond along with many other facilities.   Since our visit is during pandemic, upon entering the premise, temperature scanning (compulsory) and hand-wash/sanitizer available. We were provided with scuba face-mask and pocket sized hand sanitizer upon check-in. The hotel claimed that frequently touched surfaces in hotel premise are sanitized hourly while room seems to be sanitized and sealed at the door prior to check-in.  Hotel building is aged but well</span><span>&hellip;"
"I love the relaxing ambiance, exciting experience as well as the friendly staff. The amenities also became the highlight during our trip as Hyatt already provide everything you need in one magic box!  Even though the room interior still feels classy and old, it did not affect our sleep quality at all. It is our first time staying in Hyatt and we would love to come again someday."
"The staff is very friendly and helpful. Best place to staycation. This hotel have big swimming pooln. The garden is so big. The ambience was good. The facilities like jogging track, bicycle, golf, and more is pretty good to try"
"Wonderful experienced wth my family, also my son really loved the pool so next vacation i really put this hotel to my priority plan... If u want to taste the food i suggest banana flitter and nasi goreng kampoeng.."
"I really enjoy my stay at this 22 hectare hotel. Their hospitality was very impressive. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast served with various quality items. If you got bored, you can request simple dishes as Wonton Soup, Fried Noodle etc. My room package were included with Rice Bowl for dinner. There&#39;re 6 kinds of rice bowl in the menu for you to choose and all of them are delicious. After 20 years of operation this hotel needs remodeling, indeed. But still everything was still running very well and clean. If you are around this Hotel area, this place is extremely recommended."
I spent my birthday trip this year to do staycation in this hotel. Actually I want to enjoy the Ramayana ballet at the dinner or do afternoon tea but all that facilities was not open due to covid. The best thing was the staff made nasi tumpeng at my birthday and that&#39;s really touching.
"I just want to say .. excellent place . This is not a new building but they can maintenance this resort to keeping good condition with more than 2 hectares land . You will be not enough to stay one night only to explore this resort and feels like whatever you want  to do there . Thats food presentation for breakfast it‚Äôs complete and a delicious. Specially you come in a summer session weather of indonesia it‚Äôs really recommended. All staff so warm and helpful . There is a lot of activities in a hotel such as bike , fishing and more ... you can also playing golf in this resort . "
A very memorable experience while staying here for a few days  Very Clean Hotel and very friendly Staff And About The Food Everything is ok  Special thanks to Front Office Staff Duhita Lovas  Cant wait to stay again  See u Very soon 
"Obviously our experience at the Hyatt was skewd due to circumstances but  our stay was fabulous nonetheless.  We had planned two weeks in Indonesia (Bali, Sumba, and Yogyakarta).  The last week in &quot;Jogya&quot; at the Hyatt.  What we had not anticipated was  the impact of the pandemic COVID-19.  To our dismay all the parks and museums and in particular the Hindu temple had been closed due to the virus.  Fortunately for us the hotel had not closed although we were one of only a few guests that week.  The wait staff were superb in every way and the intense precautions they took to sanitize everything made us feel very comfortable and safe.  We exercised &quot;social distancing&quot; but still managed to enjoy the lounge, restaurant, spa, and pool.  The hotel even upgraded our room to place us</span><span>&hellip;"
"It was a pleasure to stay here. excellent service from arrival to departure. i would like to say a big thank you for making my birthday stay a huge success and that wouldn&#39;t have been possible without you guys, Popy, Acong and team is very professional,friendly and halpful they are doing great job for their guest, the room was clean quiet and beautiful with all amenities you may need. the bed was &#39;king size&#39; and very comportable for sleep. The beautiful cake when we arrived was great!,the hotel restaurant had a great buffet breakfast, my special thanks to pak Rendi which is explain anything about how good &#39;jamu&#39; is for our helath :),thanky you so much for your hospitality we had a great time and hope to stay longer next time.  good luck guys you all simply Rock!!"
"Love love love everything about this hotel. From the friendly gestures from their staffs to all the services available, I feel like a Javanese royal being in the hotel with its impressive indoor decor and outdoor landscape until... I get in to the room. The decor of the room was slightly.. underwhelming. It was all grand until I get into the room. It was good but not good enough for a grand hotel like Hyatt Regency. But that didnt dampen the experience I had. I made use of all the facilities available such as the jacuzzi, sauna, cold whirlpool, swimming pool, andhong tour around the gold course and the amazing breakfast! And I just knew they also offered the free shuttle to Malioboro which wouldve been useful since I was running out of Rupiahs on my last day in the city.</span><span>&hellip;"
"A great hotel for a group booking if you all want to have a fantastic time. Great ambiance throughout the grounds, from the Koi the size ofsubmarines to the temple that doubles as a slide into the pool. Staff are great, attentive and quick. Breakfast is great, with some amazing dishes - the crusted snapper especially. The series of pools allow space for kids to play and adults to doze.  Downsides are that it is out of the city centre, which with the traffic can take a while to get to, and accidents can happen on the slide as there is no automatic light system for safe to slide. Having a 16 stone man crash into the back of my neck at speed was not part of my holiday!"
"Most amazing and sincere service i&#39;ve ever experienced in a hotel. I&#39;m a local. Indonesian hotels tend to put more special service towards foreigners. BUT NOT THIS HOTEL.  Top notch service right from check in until check out. Facilities were impeccable. The hotel itself were quite old but very well maintained. Free andong (Yogyakarta&#39;s horse carriage) ride around the hotel facilities, free shuttle service to Malioboro, great pool, nice rooftop view,  and many other facilities that you have to experience yourself. Breakfast are awesome and always gets refilled. I need to mention ms Christine who gives us very warm welcome upon check in, and mr Sugeng, one of the chefs. He asked whether the food is nice, and then we chat like we were friends for a long time. Staffs in general</span><span>&hellip;"
"Im staying at Hyatt today for 1 night only (room 523). First impression, Hyatt is the real 5 star hotel. We were served excellent upon check in. Ms. Christine explained us the facilities and help us for check in process. She also suggested us to take picture together. And then she escorted us to the room. Woow excellent service üòçüòç When entering the room, we were really touched of the honeymoon set up we got. Actually i requested it 1 month ago and they noted it well.  i love it so muchh.. they gave us fresh red rose and slice cake and it&#39;s free.. üòç Then i explored the facilities, i came to the Club lounge and swimming pool. It has 3 swimming pool and i love it. When i took picture at swimming pool, the staff named Adam  greets me and talk with me. He&#39;s friendly guy and i like</span><span>&hellip;"
"We are celebrating our anniversary at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta and we are very thankful to all staff are friendly, especially for Front Office Team ! It was beyond our expectation. Nothing is better than going home to family and eating good food and relaxing.. thanks a lot !"
"Nice place to staying in town for a long time. I am very excited about the opportunity and the family is very happy. We can swimming, fishing, massage, tables tennis, golf, running, jogging and many more. "
"Worth to stay here in Hyatt Regency. We can enjoy the garden, the pool, and the food is soo tasty and yummy. The staffs are nice and helpful. It was really a memorable experience for me, my baby and my husband. Looking forward to stay there again !"
"Went to Hyatt for a work break and could not have been happier with probably my best 2020 purchase (it&#39;s still early but it&#39;s just that good). The service was top notch, everyone were very friendly and helpful, I though going the extra mile was just a cliche, but it certainly was as real as it gets for Hyatt. The views were sublime, the facilities were plenty, and the food were fantastic.   I could not have found any faults in this hotel aside from maybe kind of an older room design and pretty raggedy bath robe.  I will definitely be coming back."
"This hotel is highly recommended for leisure purpose. Nice, cozy, peaceful for the whole family. For those golfer this hotel also provide their hobby. Bring your children under15 years and they will enjoy."
"Exceptional facilities, good location, very clean, beautiful territory, helpful and nice staff. Nice place to yoga, meditation and massage. Great place to rest with children. Big territory with many facilities. "
"Exceptionnal Location and Services in a Natural green area The best in Yogyakarta all compared on our opinion. Awesome staff, attentive and efficient. High level food and large choice of javanese and international meals and drinks. Great experience"
I return year after year to this venue and am very happy to be returning again this year in March.  This is my favourite hotel and I travel all over the world.  Im bringing 4 colleagues with me this time in March and am so excited.  Staff and quality of hotel second to none.  
"I stay here many times since year 1999 when my son 3 years old and this resort hotel never fails me. Until now my son only want to stay in this hotel whenever we are in Jogjakarta. Everything always very good, i mostly like the pool area, 2,5km jogging track,  amazing breakfast buffet, and rooms overlooking greenery, very comfortable bed, but i mostly love is the staffs, they are all genuinely polite, always greets me by my name and always very attentive specially Anna at breakfast area, and Sugeng at the kitchen, they make a very delicious ‚ÄòNasi Goreng Kecombrang‚Äô cooked ala minute special for me at breakfast."
please consider the late check out request if justified within the allowable hotel rule as  my request for late check out during recent stay in the hotel  is rejected by receptionist with no clear reasons
"I stayed here for my cousin&#39;s wedding. The room was not ready yet when we arrived as we came before the check in time but i did love the welcoming gesture from one of your apprentice who also helped me for the check in.  The exterior is indeed very nice and it reminded me of bali.  After came back from lunch outside, we could go to our room. I saw the lady at the reception were holding my cousin&#39;s wedding booklet but she didnt give to me and only the keys so i thought the book will be for later. The room itself is really simple room with not so much interior. But it was soo noisy. There were project going on both left n right rooms beside mine and on top of mine too! So my room was like being surrounded by the project sound.  You can hear people banging and drilling the wall.</span><span>&hellip;"
Very nice hotel. Friendly staff and workers. Very Delicious food and breakfast. Excellent sport facilities. Located in a strategic area but little traffic.  Enjoyed the stay. Looking forward to stay here again. Recommended hotel.  
"Never been in a better hotel in Yogya than Hyatt Regency. Welcomed by the friendly smiles of all staffs, the check in process was quite. They had been able to accommodate our request for connecting room since we stayed with 4 kids.  Beautiful green lovely garden landscape around the hotel, made us oblivious we were in the middle of busy area in the town. Breakfast was amazing! Had various menu options from western menu to locals!  "
"Everything is awesome,,  i&#39;ve never have this such of service in any hotels,,,  such a pleasure to live in one of this room to have different experience ,, thank u very much for welcoming my family with a warm smile"
It certainly family hotel as the outdoor space is really big and green. Buffet breakfast has lots of choice (add dim sum in  your menu please...). Rooms certainly need to be updated. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Very recommended hotels.
"The people at this beautiful resort make the experience better than you can imagine. Friendly, helpful, and kind. This is an extremely beautiful property with a huge pool and a pretty golf course. A local village Bar-b-q and customary dance is available to attend Saturday nights. "
"nice hotel with a great view, room is so clean and comfortable. love the garden, pool, and you can ride andong for free. perfect for staycation with kids, no need to go outside the hotel so I can save my energy and my kids still got entertained.  breakfast was ok, lot of option for tv chanel. "
"if you wanna search quiet place but the place is still around the town of yogyakarta, you have to try this place. they have good facilities and ambience but the best about this place is their staffs are so helpful "
"rooms were a little bit old vibes comparing to other 5 star hotel in Jogja, but my room has a beautiful view to the mountain. the surroundings of the hotel was very good. staff were helpfull and nice, the entrace lobby with nature view and ponds were also very nice."
"Its a lovable place for meeting also for spending time with family. The room, bath room, conference room comfortable. The food excellent, specially the red velvet cake, i wonder whether can buy it home. The pool, the environtment, the view all is great."
"Beautiful landscape with shine and water element, makes you feel very relaxed. Kind staff and service.  WiFi connection is fast and you can connect 4 devices at the same time so don&#39;t need to use hot spot, that&#39;s great. Room equipment are a bit old but clean. It would be better if they can renew the shower equipment."
"A hotel with great atmosphere, adjacent to a 9 hole golf range. Nice landscape, good service, great food with 24 hour round the clock room service available at our disposal, great hospitality. The check in and check out was fast and precise, the cleanliness was good, the amenities were adequate. One thing though, compared to other 5 star hotels, I feel that the room could have been bigger eventhough was adequate."
This is a great hotel for a great price! I had a very comfortable stay here and hope to go back some day.  The rooms are not very new but they are clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly and helpful.  The pool is perfect! It is quite large and is divided is several areas that er connected. There is a lot of greenery so even if it is busy it still does not feel too busy. You can choose a quiet corner and relax.  You can also order food by the pool.  The hotel restaurant is also nice. Breakfast is very nice. Terrace is huge outside with a lot of trees.   I stayed here for a few days after a work trip and was really able to relax and feel like at home here.
"Pleasant stay, as always. Although the hotel quite old, the service was excellent. It‚Äôs our anniversary, and they decorated the room very personalized. Travelling with family , we need connecting rooms, they provide it even though we stay on peak season. Food is nice, but one of the key difference is their excellent staff. "
Feels like stay in my home with a lot of loving family that taking care of us with smiles. A lot of activities for my family  And the service is the best. My family enjoy the contender holiday with each other in the best hotel we called home.  
"my kids very happy with the pool... friendly staff, nice staycation, clean room, homey, breakfast was complete, lovely place to take a picture, fast respon, family friendly, clean bathroom, great experience to stay...."
"Spacious &amp; clean bedroom, bathroom is clean but the bathtub seems a little bit old so the colour is not white but yellowish &amp; there&#39;s a little &quot;crack&quot; . Love the pool area, it&#39;s so spacious and greeny, kids friendly too. Love the jogging track and the airy surroundings. Found a little bit difficult to park our car, but maybe it was because we stayed in holiday season (NYE). "
"Overall hotel condition is good and amazing, especially for its garden, resto and swimming pool. Its garden is beautiful and relaxing, except for the bike path, it seems too short, when compared to the vast area of the hotel."
"beautiful territory, welcoming staff, rooms shabby and outdated, still nicely decorated and clean, breakfast was with a good choice, but for gluten free or other allergy you have to order in advance, the bar area is very small, overall not too bad for the price"
"Big place, big pool, nice weather, good food but takes time to refill some of the food. Will be nicer if the rooms was fully covered with carpet. Ask for a golf area view if you can. The fitness center needs cleaning and the bathroom hole seems blocked."
The room and breakfast it‚Äôs very good also with the humble staff so please keep continue this good action and good attitude because Hyatt it‚Äôs a legend name for hotel in the world and hopefully there is improvement for all things 
"This hotel has more than everything we need... they have a great facilities for my family,, big pool, ponds for fishing, big garden,,,  golf, kids play room, etc. etc.,, too many to mention.  The breakfast.. it was like a feast!... The room was very clean and comfortable. The staffs are very professional, helpful and friendly. my kids had their best times.   We can&#39;t wait to go back again next year!"
"Great hotel but not with smokers still around. Not just outdoors, but they were indoors as well which were totally unhealthy for the kids around. Food was great, were just missing the traditional drinks (beras kencur, turmeric tamarind etc)."
"Very nice hotel, staff is very helpful, All is perfect, only i want the non smoking floor but is not available at that time.. but its ok because the room is very clean and smell like not a smoking room.. so its perfect stay"
"comfort place, friendly staff, javanese design, complete n delicious breakfast, little bit far from central of yogjakarta, have golf court, big swimming pool, looking for food you need walk 5-10 minutes.. overall very satisfied"
Great hotel with beautiful scenery. The swimming poll is very big. Our family very enjoy it. There are some facilities that we can use it. We can take Andong around the hotel. We like it. Thanks Hyatt .
"The hotel is old but well maintained. With such a wonderful greeneries, nice swimming pools and a lot of family activities including golf course, this resort cannot go wrong for you visit with your family. It&#39;s value for money and you will want to stay longer and just relaxing near the pools. Just if they refurbish the room, it will be even perfect because the room becomes quite old and not luxurious, compared with the other facilities."
"Very nice resort, pool are awesome, kids activities are great, nice golf. Merapi view, love it. Free andong ride. Staff are excellent. Food variety great. But room and hotel are old style, they need to renovate. Will be back soon, thanks hyatt yogya, keep up the good works."
"Excellence, staffs are polite, great services and pleasant to stay. So many activity for my kids (fishing, riding bike, golf and also riding horses).Great swimming pools. The buffet breakfasts were very good"
"The room is very old style, bath room we&#39;re not to clean. Outdoor activity is very good for family. Pool was great, food as expectation. The staff friendly. If you have kids very recommend to stay at this hotel"
"This hotel itself is huge and is stunningly beautifully. It&#39;s situated about 30 minutes from the city, but don&#39;t let that scare you away. The food in the hotel and surrounding area is very good. Be sure to spend at least 1 day in the hotel to enjoy its facilities. "
"as the title, one night is not enough to stay in this beautiful place! very clean, food are so delish and the most important one is the customer service which they are very humble and helpful always giving smiles. you will not regret to stay in this amazing hotel!! "
"The experience staying is Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta was well above expectations. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were surprised by the attention given to us by all the staff. When we arrived, we were escorted immediately to the Regency Club Lounge for check in. The staff in the lounge were all accommodating but one stood among the rest. Ms. Melryna helped us with literally everything during our stay- from our sightseeing service, to our breakfast and transfers. Also, we appreciate that she remembers our names and personally greets us every time we arrive at the lounge. The hotel is timeless charm of Javanese ambiance and its a destination itself. We enjoyed the variety of breakfast options and also with the Ala carte dining. Overall, Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is a</span><span>&hellip;"
"We came to Yogyakarta after our daughter came for her school trip and really loved it.  The Hyatt is a great hotel for kids.  There is a waterslide, rope swings, golf, fishing and more.  Our boys had the time of their lives and played non-stop all day.  Even our teenagers had a fun time.  The hotel could use a refresh but for the price the value is amazing.  Well worth it.  The staff was all very friendly and always helpful.  We did have massages which were wonderful.  The breakfast buffet huge with a wide variety of foods."
"The view was wonderful, services was excellent, kind servant, excellent facilities, suitable for family or couple vacation. Location not far from the central of Yogyakarta. The also provide shuttle to Malioboro"
"Hotel are clean and comfort with hospitality ambience. The landscape are wonderfull  with jogging track, and golf. Pool are cool and nice with good landscape. The food are delicious on breakfast and cocktail. Overall our stay are wonderfull"
"Customer since I was single from 2001. Spacious area including tropical/jungle swimming pool, golf course, gardens, and many more. Friendly staff and great selection of food. Rooms needs to be upgraded little bit though, while maintaining the rustic and traditional feeling in it. Definitely will come back again."
"I never stay at Hyatt Regency, this is my first experience and I was surprise with warm and good service, good food items and taste. the way you present the food was also interesting.  all excellence for me."
First time properly visiting Yogjakarta and I absolutely loved my stay at Hyatt. Staff are welcoming from the moment you arrive. You&#39;re greeted with a flower necklace and served a refresher while you wait to check in. Checked into my room and was welcomed by an assortment of fruits (tasty). My room had a great view of the golf course. The hotel is next door to Sasanti Restaurant that offers Indonesian &amp; Western Food. Fun fact: Obama visited that restaurant. Highly recommend Hyatt Yogjakarta to anyone visiting. 
"A hotel is only as good as its staff. No matter what the process r reputation its the staff that make the difference. At the Hyatt Regency the staff are superb. We visited Yoja last month for the first time in 25 years. Our decision to stay at the Hyatt was vindicated with a good comfortable and clean room, good food and excellent service. Loved the golf course and garden. Outdoor restaurant is excellent. Nothing was a problem for the chef or serving staff. We  look forward to a return another time."
"Hyatt Yogyakarta felt really cozy. I stayed in the hotel for the whole day, and I didnt feel bored. I mean, I will usually go out the whole day when I am on a vacation. But Hyatt hotel felt really cozy. And I loved the ambience. It was calm and peaceful. I would definitely recommend others to stay here."
"We have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta many times and the experience just keeps getting better.  The staff is consistently friendly and professional, the facilities are clean and well maintained and the food and beverage is tasty and well presented.  There is much to do in and around Yogyakarta but it&#39;s hard to leave the comfort of the Hyatt and the great pool and spa. "
"This hotel is the only hotel that have very huge open green garden (golf play ground), you can jogging and feel the fresh air. It is not far from airport thru ring road approx 30 minutes may be less out of office our. Easy to Merapi Mountain resor (kali urang). Have swimming pool and around with restaurants from local food to western style. They plan to up grade the room. If you like pizza this is the right place to taste (italian Pizza / thin one)"
"A very beautiful hotel with an excellent staff who smiles and greets you by your name everyday. Just a top atmosphere. Rooms are great, clean and spacious and the service is just perfect. Outside a beautiful garden with an relaxing pool sauna, spa and a gym 24/7 aswel. Breakfast and restaurant ( or even breakfast box) top. Mkasih banyak untuk staff. I‚Äôm enjoying every minute of my stay."
"Large &amp; clean room with classic ornament With the balcony Nice panorama  Clean bathroom with a bathup Nice food &amp; beverages Helpfull staff Good service And Very very large hotel area with swimming pool, outbond area, ect"
"it&#39;s typically resort and so old. the cleanliness of the way to go to the lobby has many dirt and I surprised when I came to my room, nothing special inside. It&#39;s different with the other 5stars hotel I &#39;ve checked in at Yogyakarta or Bali. The breakfast is good, not yet for excellent."
"We stayed for 4 nights and booked 4 rooms for us and extended families, the breakfast food was cold so we notified the manager, he fixed it for one day, but then it was cold again until we checked out, I feel that we need to get reimbursed for all the meals we ate every day. Several time we asked for fresh coconut but they ran out The pool water was murky , don‚Äôt see anyone cleaning , there was a big cockroach in our room . On the last day there was a strong paint smell that was really annoying, and my wife felt nauseous.  "
"From the serene, Ubud-like entry with pathways elevated over koi ponds to the Javanese stonework of the pool area and room tower, this Hyatt is a 5-star hotel with a price that would get you a motel room in America. We were greeted with flower necklaces, hot towels, and refreshing drinks as we waited for our room to be ready. In the afternoon we enjoyed the pool, with its rope swings, curving water slide, and lush tropical landscaping. And in the evening we had dinner at their outside restaurant, watching the beautiful sunset behind the property. Rooms were very comfortable as well, but the real treat was everything outside the rooms. Although the property is slightly outside the center, they offer a free shuttle service to and from Malioboro shopping street multiple times per</span><span>&hellip;"
"Highly recommended for people who loves nature! I love their beautiful landscape, veggies garden, pond fish, and swimming pool. You can have a lot of outdoor activities here, but I think the guest room need to be improved. Because the building is still the same from the first time (already 22 years old for now), room facilities already out of date..they need to improve the guest room. But still, I love to stay here! Room was ok, breakfast was tasty and great ambience under the trees with the pool side ‚ù§Ô∏è   Lovely staff, excellent service!   :)"
"The room feels rather small compared to other hotels of its class. The room condition and facilities are very basic, nothing special. We stayed there because our friend held her wedding in this hotel. When I needed an iron, it was not provided in the room. I had to ask THREE TIMES, twice on the phone and once in person at the reception to borrow an iron. Not sure whether I will revisit this hotel."
Well-maintained hotel with great facilities and excellent and lots of varieties of food menu.  The property is suited for both business and family holiday. Staff is attentive and always happy to help with guests&#39; inquiries. 
"Best hotel ever!!! We stay there for one week and everything was so good! Loved this hotel and the staff was so nice! Thank you for the hospitality!!!   Breakfast was buffet and so much different disches, to much to choose, rooms clean, beds very good even when you are toll. Very nice swimpool with a children slide, fitnessroom with airco. We loved everything. Feels like coming home üòç"
"We had an excelent stay here, the food were nice. What we like most are the ambience. The place has a lot facilities that can be explored during your stay here. We stayed in regency club room and most of the services and hospitality were very pleasant"
"Upon arrival they greets so well with a kind of heart. A good view on the outside lobby a concept of Javanese.  Spacious room and great amenities. This an old hotel but still exists because of the location is great and also nice foods. I like a bathroom.  Cleans and huge hotel ( 22 hectares ), has a golf court.  Some peoples not easy to find they room because has so many corridors, lift so slowly and quite long to wait.  Keep it up all ! "
been here three  days to visit Yogyakarta and temples. Relaxing environment and excellent support. restaurant quality further enhances overall experience. e also used hotel drivers for our excursions. perfect
"Absolutely amazing grounds and pool. Kids LIVED on the slide and begged to return every waking moment. So many special touches that make this resort a luxury experience - feeding koi fish in the beautiful entrance, a horse ride around the grounds, bamboo pole fishing in a pond in gardens, amazing pool and incredible gardens, free 5 min shoulder massage, yummy drink on arrival, a scented flower necklace gifted on arrival, Club Lounge is great value for appetizers and drinks, EXCELLENT service everywhere - so amazing. "
"The moment my wife and me touched down in this city, we felt we just landed on fantasy island. We were greeted by the hotel airport transfer and again upon arrival at the hotel with flower necklace.  From there on it&#39;s a whole new experience.  The staffs seems very happy attending to all guest. Mel at the Club Lounge and Tyas the therapies  at the Spa really make me want to come back again. will definitely be back to this wonderful establishment."
"Hyatt regency yogya is highly recommended for people who likes travelling in couple or family. The hotel is spacious, the pool is nice and clean. Food  are delicious. Staff are helpful with excellent experience. People are leaving with happy smile! Definetely will come back to stay at hyatt regency for next vacation..insya Allah. Thank you"
"This is a great, large, resort-style property in the city.  It&#39;s great to come back and relax after the chaos of the city.  Very friendly staff and good food at reasonable prices.  For this type of quality, you are likely to pay double or more in Bali or other more popular vacation destinations.  "
"Great hotel, magnificent gardens, great infrastructure and architecture. We just feel that after 22 years running it needs a bit of renovations in the rooms. Food is great and staff also, overall I loved to stay here."
"The grounds and the room was beautiful but the bathroom needs a little upgrading. The location was perfect between the city and Borobodur. The breakfast had Asian, Western and local sections. The indoor and outdoor dining set up was really enjoyable. There is golf course within the grounds too. We really enjoyed our stay here which was made even more enjoyable by the wonderful staff. We  will surely return again."
"I love every details in this hotel! From the room, the interior, exterior also the garden too!! Dont forget to check out their small waterpark!! So its best when u wake up early, u can walk around the hotel and feel the clean air!! Plus they have a golf course that you can play too!! Also if u fancy a spa they have it in the outdoor spa! The food is alsooo good, and they have this bazzaar street food in the week end. This just luxury in this ethnic city!!"
My husband needed a getaway from work stresses.....and this was the perfect place for it!  We spent one day touring the incredible temples but most of our time was relaxing at the hotel.  Beautiful grounds and extremely warm and welcoming staff.  We enjoyed the poolside evening buffet dinners - BBQ one night and Indonesian food the next - both were accompanied by entertainment.   The setting could not have been more relaxing and idyllic.
"Was very happy I booked the Hyatt. What a pleasant surprise. With 22 hectares of land around the hotel, you can even get lost..... Massage , fishing, biking, playing  golf , live music at dinner . . . you name it, they have it. Did not want to leave the property anymore ...."
This is the second time I&#39;ve stayed here. We were up graded to the junior suite which had a brilliant view of the pool and merapi. Great hotel to visit with kids as they love playing on the slide into the pool. Also the horse and cart ride and the fishing is lovely. Highly recommend paying a bit more for the club room for the evening snacks and drinks. 
"I was invited by the regulators on seminar about Market Conduct in Hyatt ballroom. Very interesting and beautiful place, very relaxing atmosphere. Foods are great, as well the people. Very friendly and helpful. "
"Great value, exceptional service at this gracefully aging property. You will not be disappointed.The grounds are huge, which makes it a welcome refuge from the busy streets  of Yogyakarta. Spent five nights here and loved every minute  of it."
The Hyatt Regency exceeded all our expectations. All the basics were done beyond expectation and there&#39;s heaps of activities and facilities around the hotel. It&#39;s a beautiful place to stay and the staff cannot be faulted!
"Was for only 2 days in Hyatt Yogyakarta with my family,but wished it could be longer.Plenty of things to do there. Very friendly staff,the building is amazing,in the style of the world famous Borobodur. Loved the fishing with my son."
"Just returned from nine days trip to Yogyakarta with Mum. We were extremely pleased with the hotel, staff, accommodation and service. A great location with lush green ambiance for pretty much walking to all the main attractions. This place is perfect! The hotel really made an effort to treat us well with all the small details. Warm welcoming with jasmine and sending me a rose in the morning. That‚Äôs really sweet gesture! All in all an excellent experience. Would we come back? In a heartbeat! Thank you Hyatt Regency for everything. "
"Book it without thinking twice. Service makes all the difference and these folks are out of the world. They go an extra mile to make you feel homely and are very friendly. The food is amazing both buffet and ala carte. For the price we pay, this is an unbelievable property. The surroundings are so green and serene that one falls in love immediately. Worth every penny."
"We stayed three days there. The friendly staffs were just amazing. We got respect like we were a royal family from the entrance to the receptionists. Two thumbs up.  The breakfast was just unbelievable. So many delicious Indonesian food and jamu, the herbal medicine spoiled us.  Sad that the swimming pool was a bit too cold for me though it was still August. The whirlpool was warm not hot. I saw some black Fleck around the tiles. Children were exciting feeding the gold fishes. The lady at entrance gave us the fish food.  The one I was so happy bringing my parents around the hotel. The man with Andong, horse carriage gave us a ride for free. Later my husband and children did the same.  Ps: those who don‚Äôt bring any car may take a trip to malioboro for free. The hotel provides the</span><span>&hellip;"
"The staff was very kind and pleasant, bring happiness to my kids, have tasty breakfast, large room with nice view, balcony was great as well, overall it is a lovely hotel and gave you the real experience of YOGYAKARTA is special "
"This Hotel is really a nice place for pleasure, business and travelling. Frequently I stay here with my Family. Location is not too far from Central City but we can enjoy with Golf, Swimmin, jogging track and good service"
"Clean room and bathroom nice, have great view and so natural. Probably for food may look expensive should need adjust for reach middle pocket, rate room acceptable as the facility still in range budget"
"30 minutes away from the airport and away from the city centre, its an ideal getaway place for a short trip for couples, golfers and family. Large greenery compound, big pools and a 9 Hole Golf Course plenty for you to do and relax. Needless to say room is spacious and comfortable. Staff is very pleasant and friendly. Wide breakfast spread that you can skip your lunch. Consider booking the Club Room which comes with evening cocktails, a good mini buffet spread. The hotel has free shuttle to Malibro Street, cooking classes for ladies while your guys go for a round of golf. There&#39;s a spa and the prices are reasonable. You will enjoy your stay. "
This hotel has the most spectacular gardens and surroundings. The pool area is extra special. Watching the carp in their pools was very relaxing. The staff were very respectful and communicated well. The cuisine was extra good too.
"We spent 3 nights there, in room 219 and this is for sure the best hotel to stay in Yogya !  Hotel is great, quiet, bed is so confortable it‚Äôs heaven, housekeeping is incredibly nice and professional, the bellman at the front are lovely (special mention for Rizky the concierge), the staff from the pool bar is adorable, taking care of us all the time, spa is relaxing, the messages are great as well as the pedicure and the ladies are all lovely ! Especially AMI!  And I can‚Äôt forget the staff from the restaurant. DEBI the hostess from the breakfast is remarkable. She is so kind, smiling and welcoming ! It was a pleasure to see her every morning. The breakfast was amazing, lot a of choice and tasty! (the best French bakery i have tried in Indonesia!). We had dinner twice and</span><span>&hellip;"
"Outstanding hotel, excellent service, and friendly and professional staff. Great food. Very clean. Recommend this hotel to anyone vacation in Yogyakarta. Has a 9 hole golf course, swimming pool and an outdoor dining.  Close to some of the attraction such as the temples and the Palace.  "
"I only stayed here because there were no Hilton properties in Yogyakarta.  I&#39;m glad I picked the Hyatt because the service was amazing from start to finish.  When we arrived we were welcomed the moment we exited our taxi. The was no waiting in line to check in.  We were escorted to the club lounge and welcomed with cool towels and beverages.  They acknowledged that I asked for a quiet room when making the reservation and showed us to a high floor room tucked away in the corner overlooking their beautiful grounds. Our room was clean and comfortable, but a little dated. We enjoyed our time at the beautiful pool before going to the lounge for drinks and snacks.  This was one of the nicer lounges I&#39;ve been to, and I have been to many as a Hilton diamond member.  We dined at the</span><span>&hellip;"
A friend and I got away from the children for a relaxing 2 night getaway to see the temples. Great time. Hotel was lovely. Great pool. Lovely breakfast and the staff are fantastic and friendly caring to us. 
i love the golf facilities of Hyatt and breakfast time where wide varieties of food are available. I also value highly the garden which are always kept clean and maintained wonderfully. You can take pictures here with candi and yogya related things
been here two weeks and must say the staff is absolutely incredible.  The breakfast buffet is just perfect and cannot say enough about the food.  Rooms are just fine and if anything is wrong they fix them right up.  I cannot say enough to thank the staff of the Hyatt for being just what I am looking for relating to a stay in Yogyakarta.  And don&#39;t forget the women are beautiful.   So if you just want to sit and have a drink I bet you your eyes wander until you fall asleep...All the best
Nice and peace hotel. Comfortable for stay and relax after hard and tired of work. It can make your heart and body become fresh. Also it has a very friendly and helpfull staff. There a vehicle to go to the central market in Malioboro street... 
"Clean and comfy room. loves the breakfast, especially the craft section !. highly recommended for family. your kids will love the pool and the garden. Many spots for your Instagram photo and it is close to many yummy food around the hotel !"
"This hotel is a gem in Yogyakarta. It is a sprawling resort set amidst lush greenery and a 9-hole golf course which skirts around the hotel. Despite the noisy traffic in the city surrounding the hotel, it is usually very quiet. The hotel offers everything you need to relax or even have a workweek there: Large swimming pool, gym, table tennis, tennis court, running track, massage parlour, and many other facilities. The only thing missing is the beach! The staff is so friendly and always welcomes me the warmest, remembers my needs and wishes, and always provide service swiftly and to the highest quality. Many hotels can learn from this.  Rooms are spacious with picturesque views of the greenery, with large bathrooms. Some have only bathtubs and lack shower cubicles, but many have.</span><span>&hellip;"
"I am Yoga Efendi, a Traveler from Yogyakarta. I saw with my own eyes the improvement of this hotel.   My Belgium friends (Mr. Johan and Family) stayed for 2 nights here and they loved it.   The receptionists team very smiling, nice, and wonderful. Excellent impression. The check in process was amazing. The rooms were clean, the buffet was delicious, and the view was spectacular.   Some foods are different everyday. So, Hyatt was doing great job since my last visit. Very recommended hotel. "
"The staff are very helpful. They are very friendly. The hotel decorations are gorgeous. Very well kept clean. The Angsa travel agent is very good in planning our pickup from the airport, all our tour including our meal.  Thank you. "
"We just spent 5 nights at this resort with two young kids and it was a great experience.  It was so nice to be greeted with the fresh jasmine necklaces and go right to the club lounge to relax during check in.  We loved the traditional entrance and visiting all the big koi in the pond.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful!  The room was very large with 2 balconies looking out towards Mt Merapi volcano, and had at least 5 separate fresh flower arrangements which was such a treat for me.  The fresh freesia in the bathroom smelled sooooo good!  There were always fresh fruit and complementary cookies and local dessert.  Speaking of food, the breakfast buffet had a great selection of classics and local dishes.  I liked being able to try some of the local dishes that were nicely</span><span>&hellip;"
"This is a sprawling resort set amidst lush greenery and a mini Golf course which skirts around the hotel in this charming historic City in Java.  It‚Äôs the perfect retreat for the family in many ways.  The staff are trained well to please and the rooms are spacious with picturesque views of the greenery. Food is excellent.  The only thing that really needs attention is their bathrooms which don‚Äôt have shower cubicles, and this becomes a risky balancing act for elderly folks when standing in the long bath! "
The staff in this hotel were amazing. They were so helpful and friendly and no request was any problem. They made our stay very special and I highly recommend this hotel it&#39;s a small piece of heaven in Yogyakarta. Our daughter Duva misses you all and sends her love.
"aJust about perfect would describe The hyatt regency hotel, not perfect only because we couldn&#39;t walk into town though with the traffice walking wasn;t the best options.We easily caught taxis at the hotel   We usually do not stay in 5 star hotels but we got a great deal on room and breakfast it was hard to past up We loved the grounds especially a pool that you could do laps.Food was varied but generally very tasty. Staff were wonderful, would stay again   Why yogy?  the borobudur 9century Buddhist ruins, the worlds largest buddhist temple"
"Due my trip to visit my daughter in Yogya, I decided to stay at Hyatt Regency. Been there 2 years ago and I remembered how beautiful their pool area and jogging track, a perfect pic to just stay relax while staying there. So as expected the team of Hyatt warmly welcome us and check in experience was smooth. But when we entered the room I felt a bit disappointed because it looked rundown and small, although it was clean. During breakfast time, another surprise to see that for such considered expensive hotel apparently offered a limited-less variety of food. Luckily most of the food we tried tasted good and again the service from Hyatt team itself was good, everyone was nice and helpful. Still I would recommend this hotel due to location and an ideal place too to relax as the</span><span>&hellip;"
"The landscaping,  the Golf-view, and the local music/instruments have always been so alluring for the visitors.. The room is always well-maintained..Although we as a frequent visitor didnot get any up-grade this time, due to the heavy season during the National Independence-day, which fell on the 17th of August..  The variety of cuisines at the Breakfast court has always been very attractive to the guests.. Keep it up and improve as best you can..  Looking forward to seeing you soon.. Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta!! "
"This Hyatt Regency offers the warmest hospitality by the friendliest people in all the world. Seriously and honestly, the service here is the best we&#39;ve experienced among the Hyatt chain. We were and remain thoroughly impressed.  The gluten-free breakfast that was whipped up by the chef each morning was a wonderful and refreshing treat! I felt spoiled having such attentiveness during the breakfast rush. The staff would let the chef on duty know I had arrived, the chef then came out to greet us and ask and suggest the daily breakfast items, and then disappear to whip it up. He did a marvellous job! Each day, I was treated to real gluten-free pancakes (not the Vietnamese rice pancake type), a huge plate of stir-fried bee hoon noodles with eggs and an extra dose of veggies, and</span><span>&hellip;"
"Very nice pool in the garden, very nice and big garden . Breakfast is very good . Staff is friendly . Club is not what we experienced in Asia so far but its also very cheap , nice to have a cocktail chart . Food is just a very light menu . Location is outside the city but there is a free shuttle hourly . The bike tour for 3 hours is excellent . (congrats to the guide who works also at the pool) . This is probably one of the least expensive Hyatt Regencies around .  Rooms are older but we had a superb sight !"
The hotels grounds are beautiful.  Lobby is beautiful. Desk staff very nice and helpful. Short distance to airport if not peak traffic hours.  Only complains are that rooms appear old and worn out with dated decor. Staff in restaurant not very attentive to the customers 
From front desk to the housekeeping... they are excellent‚ù§Ô∏è We do love your welcoming drink üçπ  I‚Äôm going to miss your breakfast especially Jamu and fudge. Evening Lemon Squash in the lounge ü§© We would like to come back soon!
"Everything was perfect, the room, the people and the food was great, I will recommend it during periods honeymoon, and during summer as u can see the view on Merapi and Merbabu mountain it was amazed view."
"good hotel and staff are very welcomee. recomeended if u want to stay at yogyakarta the taste of fodd was very good,comfor like home Good Job hyatt Yogyakarta for kids so many activities in this hotel,if u like to play all day in Hotel. "
"Just that the room is a bit old, the bath tube is very slipery and cause fall down. Staff are friendly with some can understand english well. hotel food is so so, walking distance has very less option of local food"
"The surrounding city is somewhat dirty and chaotic so the Hyatt is a beautiful retreat. Would be nice just to stay on hotel grounds for several days and never leave hotel. The pool is great, has a fun waterslide, and the price is great value for the hotel. The rooms are a little dated and could use an upgrade though. Staff at restaurant slow, but overall minor complaints"
"Great hotel.  Lovely staff, beautiful facilities (the pool was astounding), and left one feeling like they were staying at a resort.  Prices were a tad high. Overall though, a very repeatable experience! "
"beautiful and peaceful hotel, all food are delicious, view is so wonderful, lovely hospitality, all is great! wanna be back again, with all of my family for Yogyakarta holiday. I love your green Hyatt"
"Every single staff member was gracious and genuine. I truly felt like a guest instead of a customer. The grounds are beautiful and the pool is peaceful and relaxing. The rooms are showing some age, but everything worked well and that didn‚Äôt detract from my experience. I wish all hotels were like this. "
"I would give this hotel a 4.5 star rating mainly for its excellent service. We stayed in a junior suite which was very spacious for our family of four. All the staff were extremely friendly and made it a point to greet us.   Many kid-friendly facilities here, including a water slide in the pool, a swing under a tree, a maze for kids, ping pong table, and a fish pond which was the highlight for my kids as they loved to feed the fish using feed that the staff provided.   Hotel is located a little far from the main area but for us that appealed as location was nice and quiet. They provided shuttle service every two hours to Malioboro Street as well which was useful.   Breakfast spread was wonderful and food was delicious. Only one restaurant in the hotel though so if you want</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed here for the second time, this time to attend my daughter&#39;s convocation at Gadjah Mada University. The last visit was rushed and I only had a superficial grasp of the hotel. This time my family had more time and I must tell you that it is worth exploring.  Wonderful pristine walk paths, nice pools, a friendly massage and sauna area, really comfortable picturesque rooms, wide array of foods, extremely professional staff and natural smiles complementing the elegance of Yogyakarta traditions. This is one hotel you must visit before you die. It outranks all other Yogyakarta accomodation offerings by a mile.  Whilst there one lady guest suddenly fainted, and within minutes an Oxygen tank and wheelchair arrived at the scene. That was the cherry in the pudding."
"Nestled midst acres of greenery and a 18 hole golf course, a wonderful swimming pool setup, this is a perfect getaway for large family / groups and golf aficionados. Hospitality of staff is top class, a must visit"
"Its a nice place to spend days in Yogya, especially when we entertain customers, because the location near to Merapi Golf, even though in Hyatt Regency itself has a 9 hole golf course. And also near to the adventure activity, like Rafting at Sungai Elo. "
"The interior is dated but feels right for the theme. Rooms are basic, but the landscape is beautiful. Food was very good and the tables under the tree by the pool. Friendly staff and would definiety come back and recommend."
"My office had booked over than 100 rooms, the meeting rooms, outdoor restaurant for 3-4 days. I was very surprised with a very rude, unpleasant and unfriendly ladies hotel‚Äôs staff who refused me to enter the toilet with the reason that i‚Äôm not staying at the hotel (note: see the picture below of the ladies who is very rude). Eventhough, i was badly need to use the toilet, she still insist to refuse me. I suggest the hotel to train staffs to have a better attitudes and etique to give a better service to guest. I‚Äôm very disappointed, and other five star hotels has a better services to the guests."
"the room is old and basic. amenities could be improved. otherwise, the pool and landscapes are great, give us  Bali-feels. pool water however needs to be clean regularly cz a lil bit dirty. jacuzzi and sauna also need some refreshment. "
"Had amazing experience with this hotel. The view was amazing, the food was delicious, and the vibes also peaceful. The room interior can be much better.  The hospitality of this hotel is amazing, There is no doubt that Hyatt is World-Class Hotel"
"the service is good and the rooms although old but all function properly and are clean.good food, lots of hotels with swimming pools.there is a view of the golf course.only rooms with balconies are not good enough."
"Great hotel to mix business and leisure. The staff were warm, helpful and friendly. Room is clean and neat. Good variety of food. Location is perfect. Plenty of choices of corners to have a one on one business discussion. "
"Great hotel, with wonderful atmosphere. If you prefer a serene place to stay, the Hyatt Regency can be your choice. Clean and comfortable, great staffs, great food served for the breakfast buffet. A little bit far from the city center or places-to-go downtown, but transportation is quite easy."
"I was warmly welcomed and enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt very much. The staff was so friendly, courteous and professional. They helped me rent a car for my visits to the various nearby temples. I highly recommend this establishment"
"always love Hyatt touch.. The services all of staff very warm, the ambience  hard to say  calm and excellent.  Surprisingly... most people said that hotel food was trouble, but we what we got was different, the breakfast so tasty and full of foods... we&#39;ll be back again soon."
"One of very few hotels in Jogja with garden surround. Great ambiance, staffs are polite and friendly. Kids love the swimming pool. Well maintained hotel despite its aging looks since everything in the room works perfectly.  Like the big TV in the room. "
Just need to renovate rooms. Old furniture but clean rooms. Good space. Good food. Had problem as Im a vegetarian but the staff and chef sugeng help us to make special dish. Very helpful. Would surely visit again. Free cycling and horse ride for children and adults.Excellent huge sw pool. 
"Nice room, clean, friendly staff and nice environmental. Not too far from malioboro, not have trafic jam. Have a golf field with green yard and beautiful fish pond. Nice pool, food and sport fasility."
"Generally all the staff and food are beyond expectations.  Room are good and clean, just perhaps something need to be repairs but it‚Äôs just minor things.  The pool and jogging track is awesome.  And if you love to play golf this place can be the best for you to stay also.  Summary : Awesome  place to stay if you visit jogja. "
"Flawless service. Good facitlities. Commendable breafast and dinner, they do serve buffet for dinner. But it occur on one/ 3 nights of our stay only. Spacious and beautiful room. Totally worth every penny spend here! The concierge service guy was also very helpful in helping me and my wife "
"My kids love the pools and the outdoor activities; Mini golf, fishing and cycling arround the hotel. We will not found these kind of service in any other hotel in Jogja city. Nice place to relax. I think it would be good if they could renewing the room interior, because it looks a bit old."
"My family and I spent a short vacation at the Hyatt Yogyakarata, My wife and I had a very special experience with Yogya because we were both studying in Yogya. Vacationing here is very enjoyable because of the strategic location of the hotel, perfect facilities and services, we always want to go back to Hyatt jogja"
"Hotel mewah menyatu dg alam. Sangat puas stay di Hyatt,tidak ingin pulang,nice pool,good breakfast beside the pool. Good service from all staff,nice place,awesome view and big pool. Need more time to wait my dragon fruit juice to be ready while twice i am come to the juice stand. But,for next i&#39;ll be there to stay in Hyatt."
"Cant go wrong for choosing this hotel for your stay for any occasion, the facilities are well kept and good even you can see that this hotel has old building but well maintained rooms and facilities. The pool and outdoor activities are excellent, plus the view is stunning.  The people work here also makes the big difference... "
"Good hotel with nice and variation of food, clean hotel room but need to refresh. Good location near to the city. The staffs are very friendly and helpful as well. Good for family holiday, nice for company conference with lot of outdoor activities."
"If you need a place to relax and away from the hustle bustle city life, this is the place for you and more if you like golf. I am staying 2 weeks for work purpose but there was one day I just stay in my room relaxing and well rest and the food is delicious from breakfast, lunch to dinner. It might expensive for some but that was nothing compare to the view and ambiance offered by the hotel. Overall my staying in that hotel is excellent "
"The ground is extraodinary. Every morning we always have things to do like swimming or just a morning walk with great view. The minute we came we receive great hospitality from the staffs. The requested baby cot ready in the room by the time we&#39;re arrived. My room have view to the garden and it&#39;s perfect. The interior of guest room I think is a little old and need renewal but still comfortable.  Breakfast is tasty and wide range but can be better. Everyday we get fruit and flowers from room service which is nice gesture. Overall it was a great holiday we have here, and definitely will come back if we visit Yogya again."
"I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel but was really disappointed.  We had a nightmare first night which included a welcome with no information (eg no breakfast times), mouldy fruit waiting in our room, a broken toilet flush, a sink tap which loudly exploded when we tried to run it (pressure suggested the room hadn&#39;t been used for a while) and then the water came out brown!, we then ran the bath to see if this also had brown water which it did and lumps of dirt came out, the telephone didn&#39;t work (had to run down to report these things), ordered room service and the food turned up cold and with only one set of cutlery and we were told the water the room service came with in a glass was &#39;not drinkable&#39; (turns out this was a communication issue).  We were then</span><span>&hellip;"
 Breakfast was delicious and very expanded. The environment was magnificent and the customer service was perfect. The communication between the workers was really good. The best hotel I have ever stayed. 
"Great hospitality,relaxing atmosphere,nice breakfast quality &amp; outstanding swimming pool design are something that Hyatt guest will meet.So if you looking for best place to stay while in Yogyakarta,this is it..well done Hyatt Regency.."
I stay during lebaran and 5 nights... its not as crowd as I though but the recepction say all room is fully booked. Car park area is better because the hotel has been cut the tree that makes the car dirty because of those tree. But closest car park are feel by hotel&#39;s car.. it should be for guest car right?
Hyatt Yogya has always been my 2nd home...It is amazing to see how things are still well maintained and the service provided were consistent and excellent as always...A bug thank to the great team there
"We had a great time staying at Hyatt Yogyakarta. Enjoy with the garden and swimming pool. The serivce is very satisfying, buffee breakfast very much kind and good, staff were very friendly and helpful"
"After stay in in here, my children want stay again if we have vacation in jOgja. Why? They said like their expected. Like feeding koi fish, playing golf, etc. But, they was disapointed because when their fishing, the fishing tackle not complete and that fish not big. Maybe will ectited for children, if have fishing game event. Overall, it&#39;s ok "
"Just Love it, i&#39;ve been here like three or four times and never disappoint on every visit, always good food, good service, lovely staff and hotel landscape is amazing, can&#39;t wait to comeback again and I will definitely coming back :)"
"The hotel is far enough from city center (were trying to avoid holiday crowd/traffic) but still close to many attraction and shopping center. Numerous coffee shops and diners nearby, around 10-15 mins driving. Hospitality was top-notch. Basically flawless throughout the stay. We put bed type in request but had not mentioned connecting room - took 5 mins for front desk to get us one. It&#39;s not a new establishment obviously but everything was in very good condition. Tap water was a bit dirty in the beginning but cleared out right away after few seconds of running. Great breakfast variety too, to be expected from Hyatt though."
"Hyaat Regency Yogyakarta is a very good hotel surrounded by beautiful garden, and also very suitable for golf lovers. The hotel has an excellent jogging track and a comfortable place for vacation. the hotel is on the edge of the Yogyakarta city but very easy to reach by taxi from airport or train station. I&#39;m sure you will be satisfied to stay at the hotel. "
"Generally speaking people come to Yogyakarta as a base to visit Borobudur and Prambaman, which we also did. We chose the Hyatt Regency as our base and what a brilliant choice it is. The grounds of the hotel and the swimming pools are a delight. We are currently here during Ramadan so it‚Äôs under occupancy. Our room 426 is a deluxe non smoking. It has air con, a safe, tea/coffee facilities, tv with English speaking channels. It‚Äôs clean, big enough and all that we need. There isn‚Äôt a balcony but who needs it when you can sit in the grounds. What really makes it fit us is the staff. They are so gracious, smiling, polite and eager to help/please. My wife and I would defo recommend this place to family and friends. My wife also recommends the full body massage ( happy hour between</span><span>&hellip;"
I only stayed 1 night but it is a beautiful resort. Everything was as expected from the helpful efficient check in to the beautiful breakfast. I used the free shuttle into town and walked the track around the grounds. Great stay!
"This property is amazing, after traveling all day it was so lovely to check into this hotel.  Initial thoughts were just...wow!  Check in was handled by the staff in the Executive Lounge who were so helpful, professional and friendly.  Rooms were well appointed and big, bathrooms were clean and large.  Breakfast selection even during Ramadan was fantastic, the staff in the restaurant were always accomodating.  The various pools were brilliant and the hotel grounds were stunning.  I chose this property as it was outside of the city centre, but if you need to get into town the hotel supplies a shuttle bus.  I have never felt so relaxed in a hotel like I did here. I can&#39;t wait to come back just for this property!!"
"The hotel can be reached from Airport and City Centre within 30 mins. The picture of the property with lush greenery, fish pond, golf course and a temple like decor prompted me to book and here under are my feelings : What is good : Staff is polite and courteous. Check In was smooth and we were greeted warmly in the Club Lounge which offers good cocktails and light bites. Not a good spread for a vegetarian though. The outdoors is indeed nice and serene and we had a good time swimming and catching fish from the pond (but pls put wheat dough than bread as bread dissolves in water first). Golf, Cooking Classes and Rice Field Tour are available on chargeable basis. There was a free horse ride to the adjacent golf course but made no real sense. The Iftaar  buffet spread was</span><span>&hellip;"
"Top notch customer services! Many facilities; big swimming pool, gym, table tennis, golf, cycling route etc. And the heath club with warm / cold pool and suana. There is also free Andong ride which is fun.   Room with a view of Merapi volcano from afar. We joined the golf for beginner activities, the coach is patience and the lesson fun. The lesson also includes a buffet dinner after class.They have different classes daily, highly reccomended to join these classes."
"The location is not far from the city center but it is just like a hidden place out of the crowd. The staff are helpful, the food are tasty, the pool and playground are perfect for children to play during the stay. The room style and furniture are bit old but the bathtub is a good choice to relax without going out of the room."
"Represent jogjakarta vibes and culture. It‚Äôs like a temple. Location is not so far from airport, i like the foods, service, and wifi. Maybe not the fastest wifi, but the connection is great, i can connect everywhere i want around the hotel."
"a very beautifull hotel..the design is epic. A very good place to take a short get away..  they served a good cold brew javanesse coffee..but the other food served here not really impressed me (I tried the tiramissu, ferrero choco cake , terderloin steak and the kemangi fish)  I order this because so many ppl give a good review about it but for me the taste is just an average. but..really..I love the coffee.  make sure to try the spa and joglo massage/shiatsu..it&#39;s good!  but, they need to upgrade the cleanliness and change some part of the room with the new one. (so many rust in the bathroom and some of the furniture)  afterall..I do enjoy my stay here. With some of improvement, I will sure comeback whenever I go to yogyakarta."
"Out of business trip we stayed a total of sadly only 2 nights. As we see a lot of different hotels during our trips, hyatt is definetly one of the best we have visited ever! Never seen such a friendly staff anywhere in the world! Dinner and breakfast is very tasty - a big mix out of asian, indonesian and europe meals is served. The hotel has also a very big golf course and also serves alcohol in their own club with terrace. Once we come back to Yogjakarta, we will definetly stax here again! 10/10 would visit again - thanks to the lovely staff and perfect service."
"It&#39;s located not very far from city center. You can take the free hotel shuttle to city center. All the staffs that we met were very friendly and helpful.  Other than the room furnishing was a bit old, everything was fine and in good condition. I would recommend to stay at the Regency Club floor where you can have club lounge access for breakfast and evening cocktails."
You can just go to the hotel and spend your holidays.  It has a great outdoor pool like small lakes connected with each other.  Great area and relaxation facilities. Plan on having more than 2 nights staying at Hyatt.
"Hyatt hotel is luxurious hotel. The location is not to far from malioboro,the ikon of jogja. Room hotel is clean and the room fasilities is complete. Hotel fasilities is complete and the staff very helpfull so i stay in hyatt is very good experience. "
"I&#39;ve been a loyal customer of Hyatt Regency Yogya and always stay at Hyatt Regency every time I come to Yogya. As a loyal customer I expect good cooperation from the staff. However, this time I got bad experience. Very disappointing regency club feedback for 1H late check out. Not helpful at all. Only after escalation to the GM then the request was granted. "
"I am impressed by the landscape of Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta and hope to stay at the same hotel when I visit again. The cons will be it is far from the city but if you are close to the city, you can&#39;t get this tranquil and calm feel."
This place is great for the ambience and facilities for long stay 3spwcially if you are using a suite.  The staff are very friendly and the kitchen staff go out f the way to serve you any special requests for food so that you are comfortable and you don‚Äôt miss home.
"This is my second time staying in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, with family and friends. Well, both times were great and this hotel still in my top list property to stay in Yogyakarta. Keep up the good work. Thank you"
"The garden and pool are beautiful, excellent for children but can get very crowded on Sundays. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms need urgent refurbishment, furnitures and installation are worn down "
"not many word for describe, hyatt is the best hotel in yogyakarta in all aspect, food variety and taste is wonderful, atmosphere is amazing..staff very care..will stay again in future..facility is very good and maintained.."
F &amp; B should be more catered towards international food .as mentioned earlier food is very limited in selection and breakfast was appalling in quality . More focus should be on offering value for money for a 5 star resort 
"My family and I had a fantastic stay at this hotel. The staff were very kind, welcoming  and very helpful. Top notch service. Great facilities and a wide range selection of food for the hotel breakfast. Thank you Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for making my family&#39;s holiday beautiful. We hope to return soon!"
"This was our second stay at the Hyatt- our group of 9 was there on a family holiday, and we had 3 rooms on the club level. Checkin was smooth, the rooms were clean, but the hotel is very outdated and in need of a renovation- old finishes, very retro furniture, etc. The club lounge service was very friendly and prompt, good selection during the happy hour. Our kids used the kids club which was sufficient, and they seemed well looked after. We also had great massages at the spa, as well as a fantastic hair creambath- it&#39;s a nice facility and it&#39;s clear the staff are well trained. The pool area was great for relaxing after a day of sightseeing, but service from the pool bar/restaurant was slow and disorganized; the breakfast buffet had great selection and good service. We took</span><span>&hellip;"
"vacationing with family at the Hyatt Yogyakarta hotel gives a pretty good impression, getting an excellent service from lobby to room. breakfast complete food and good service from all staff. Hyatt Hotels in Yogyakarta will be my favorite hotel and family. "
"Overall my experience at the Hyatt was excellent. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The pool was probably the best hotel pool I&#39;ve ever seen. The hotel breakfast had a wide selection from different cultures. The spa was clean and comfortable and the masseuse did a great job. As others have written, the common areas (dining room, pool, etc.) seem to be more modern and renovated than the actual rooms. However the room was still comfortable. Note there is air conditioning, but this is Indonesia: don&#39;t expect the AC to remove the humidity.  One comment: there is a bar with pool tables and live music at night. It&#39;s called Bogey&#39;s Teras (Terrace). They don&#39;t seem to promote Bogey&#39;s like their other services and it&#39;s easy to be unaware the place even exists. Bogey&#39;s is in</span><span>&hellip;"
"The place was so special, not only the spectacular pool, which is obvious, looking at the photos only, but nice people and great food, that exceeds expectations. Well done Hyatt! Hope to be back one day!!! "
"I stayed for 9 days, quite comfortable stay with nice restaurant, swimming pool, lots of greeneries and traditional old sculptures.  Many varieties in breakfast and dinner. Lovely ambience of restaurant, indoor and poolside. Music and cultural night.  Rooms needs to have better maintenance and almost 20 - 30 min distance from city center."
"I stayed 4 nights and it was really nice. My kid really loved the swimming pool. We enjoyed the food very much, the staffs were very kind to us. Overall we had a good time. We surely going to be back again."
A lovely oasis in the middle of a busy city  I always feel like I‚Äôm returning home when I stay at this hotel the status gracious the setting is beautiful building impressive amenities in beds very comfortable breakfast buffet exceptional 
"Fabulous hotel with amazing staff, pool and  tranquil atmosphere.  It‚Äôs great fot kids.  Hotel rooms are tired and in desperate need of updating, but the beds are comfortable and it‚Äôs dark. ai would recommend the spa treatments (a bargain) and the cycle tour with Henri. Gym is small and not very inspiring."
We had a fantastic stay at this hotel.  The service provided from the staff was exceptional.  We visited the spa and the massage packages were cheap and very good.  Overall we had a fantastic stay here and I would highly recommend to anyone in the area to stay here.
"Very cosy, comfortable hotel . Excellent friendly staff and very helpful indeed. The food is also very good. The property is very green and relaxing. As far as the location is concerned, it is quite far from the centre of town, but still ok ."
"I stayed for 4 nights about several months ago.  Booked in king room with balcony on the corner.  Entering the hotel, it was nice and spacious. They got nature ambience surrounding the hotels.  Lobby was amazing, liked the lightning and decoration. Check in process was smooth, they got me applied to hyatt membership instead.  All the way to the room, the interior of hallway was nice. But entering the room, it was like traveling back 10 years ago. Everything was old. Even the decoration. Remove that big tv table cause tv already flat typed. Not only the room, but hotel building surely needs a renovation.  Breakfast was fantastic. And the pool was great. Liked the swimming pool a lot  Staffs were exceptionally nice and helpful  In general, everything was nice and okay except for</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel is a bit outside the busy city of Yogyakarta and is therefore in a quiet green environment with a golf court, a beautiful swimming pool and views on the volcano Merapi if weather allows.  The kitchen is excellent and the staff is superb.  Very friendly and always ready to help with a big smile.  From there you can easily visit the famous landmarks like Borobudur and the Prambaran temple.  "
"Respect for the staff, it seems they save all preferences from their guests from the past and read the wishes from their lips.  in addition, the location is of course a major asset. Decoration in and outside the hotel makes it enjoyable. "
"amazing hotel, good food, good service, and staff with good English.  Though located at the heart of the city, it was surrounded by greenery The hotel environment has a sense of typical Indonesia touch, that make it authentic.   only set back is the dinner at the bar took much longer time than expected to be ready. "
"Staying at the Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta was an unforgettable experience. From the point of arrival - that we stepped out of the taxi (received our flower necklace, welcome drink and hot towel), until stepping back in the taxi on our day our departure (with our minds and hearts full), we were thrilled with the details that this hotel provided.  1) Culture: The hotel is built with the local culture in mind - the structure itself resembles Boroburdur. We recommend booking temple outings through the hotel - the prices and guide quality are unbeatable. You really want to book the best, as Boduburdur temple is truly an astounding architectural masterpiece and and archeological find, emphasizing the path to enlightenment. Book the guided tour and ask for Tony, and it will be an</span><span>&hellip;"
"The Best room I ever seen. and I love that. so much !! cleanliness. the balcony is very cool ! I like it, food and beverages so delicious ! I am very happy when I can Breakfast at Hyatt.  Thankyou Hyatt, to made my Holidays so Beautiful !"
"Great hotel for almost any reason. Good city with plenty to see and do in both culture and nature. The hotel is in a beautiful location with great staff, good food and all a reasonable price. This is a hidden gem!"
"as 5 stars hotel, I don&#39;t need to review the service, food, room, view, of course they are super gucci. But, one thing I always curious from the 5 stars hotels is the gym.  Hyatt has a generally displeasing gym. Pretty fine with the complete dumbbells, fitness benches, Lat pull down machine, pec deck fly, rowing machine, chest press, but only 2 treadmills and a cross trainer, in a small room. I suggest to renovate it, make it bigger, add more treadmills and some space just for stretching. Good view though. I run and some birds here and there. Unfortunately, I just forget to take a picture of the gym."
"Thank you all for an amazing stay, the best we had so far in Jogjia after staying at several other 5star properties in previous years. Everyone remembered our names and always had a smile on their face. Pak Nur is leading a great team. The SPA treatment was great too and breakfast is great with a lot of choices, both local and international.  We hope to return soon."
"This hotel has a breathtaking view of Gunung Merapi, a gorgeous large pool area and the employees are very friendly. I dined at Kemangi Bistro on a Saturday night which showcased a delightful buffet and a Gamelan and Ramayana show. The Sunday Brunch was wonderful and had many food options to chose from. What made my experience a pleasant one were the employees. They were all very attentive to myself and everyone else and very personable.  This hotel is suitable for families and solo travelers. The health club facility could use a little attention but overall my stay was superb!"
"We had a wonderful time at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, which has proven to be a magic hotel. Guests have the feeling as if they were kings and queens, who came into the magic garden, filled with beautiful plants! I am in love with Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta"
"This really is a beautiful hotel. Our room had a lovely private balcony and stunning garden view. The pool area is wonderfully landscaped and there are areas for all, children and adults.  The staff were all fantastic, especially our waiter Ari who was very amusing.  At the New Year dinner a chef called Sugen told us all about the dishes and was very interesting. The shuttle bus into town was very useful."
Stunning resort with stunning facilities. Warm staff and overall great hospitality. We enjoyed as a family spending a lot of time on the hotel grounds as there is so much to see and do. We also conveniently toured around the city.
"Stay here for 3 days 2 nights. The hospitality was superb. Great hotel facility for kids. Cozy pool, delman driver was food and kids love fishing here.  The foods was very good, and all the staff were very helpful and friendly.   Definitely will come back again to this hotel.  Thank you Hyatt"
"I can only commend the Grand Hyatt Yogyakarta.  It is the kind of place that if I could afford not to leave I would‚Äôt. This is my second stay at the Hyatt here in the last few years and it is a sanctuary from the busy streets of Yogyakarta and retreat from life wherever you may come from.  The staff, from the GM to a server treated me with the utmost kindness.  The waterslide, for which I‚Äôm sure is meant for children was used extensively by myself and I indulged my inner child.  I would recommend an upgrade to club access if you can afford it for an extra level of care.  The staff exhibit a real sense of family &amp; community as I watched them interact with one another and the guests.  The staff even have a band that plays for the guests (how cute is that).  My only hesitation to</span><span>&hellip;"
"First up, the service is excellent.. however the hotel (like many things in Indonesia) needs an upgrade! The rooms are very tired, old wood with a pain and varnish scratchings/chips.. bed is very uncomfortable and the taps in bathroom and shower leak and the shower can‚Äôt maintain consistency in water temp. The running track is overgrown and in fact has large trees and a fence fallen down on top of it, the gym is pathetically small and has a small collection of free weights. The breakfast buffet is really poor, terrible coffee, dry bread and poor quality fruit. Apart from that it is a very beautiful hotel and the staff will do anything they can to help. Just need to update and maintain the hotel .. this is 3 stars at best .. however you get what you pay for ! $120 a night is not</span><span>&hellip;"
Very satisfied with all aspects of my recent 6 night stay in this tranquil property. The food and beverage experience is one of the best I have tasted in a hotel this size. Service was warm and gracious. What I enjoyed most was the grounds and the expansive pools which really made me stay within the hotel for what I needed most: a relaxing experience. Will definitely return.
"We love our stay in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. We have 2 kids, 4 and 2 years old. and they enjoy every moment of our stay. Big pools, water slide, big garden. only thing they missed is playground for kids, not big enough. will be great if they have big playground like they do in Hyatt Bali. But overall, we love our stay here. :) "
"Surroundings, service, &amp; facilities are great. Breakfast buffet needs improvement. The worst part was our mattress was already worn out, minimal firmness &amp; support. Andong free ride is such a pleasure."
"A very nice hotel with excelent hospitality.. all the staff are helpfull and nice. If they could just upgrade the  rooms a bit, giving excelent rating is a no brainer. Really love to come back there again."
"Very relaxing time, great private room balcony, superb golf course for early learners like us.Staff were very attentive, made us feel special.Have used the pools in the past and usually plenty of pool space to find your own cozy area"
"We were happy that we chose Hyatt Regency Yogjakarta despite initial misgivings about the age of the property.  The warm, friendly and knowledgeable staff won us over with their genuine care and concern and their initiative in ensuring that every little detail of our stay were taken care of. From handling last minute changes to our restaurant reservations to real-time traffic advice in helping us navigate Yogjakarta without our own car, nothing was too difficult for the wondering Hyatt Team at Yogjakarta.. little wonder as some of them (like our lovely regency club manager) have been with the hotel for over 15 years! These loyal staff are the true brand ambassadors for the Hyatt brand who truly make a stay at the property memorable and distinguishes Hyatt Regency Yogjakarta as</span><span>&hellip;"
"Very satisfied with staff, nice, helpful and very welcoming. If tou want to have relax and release stress, Hyatt Yogya is the choice. Many choices of local food during breakfast, very nice view, you can enjoy every corner of the hotel. "
"Staff friendly, food excellent. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Very generous with bottled water in the room. Restaurant and breakfast very high standard and well priced. Rooms serviced well. Perfect place to stay!"
"Make no other choice! Best hospitality.... perfect setting.... great pool. Rooms need an update but hotel has scheduled this. Still, Breda are good. Shower is perfect. So take it for granted that the decor is a bit dated as all the rest is worth it staying here!"
"Travel here for the first time and couldn&#39;t believe that this establishment was there for more than 20 years! Rooms we&#39;re comfortable and nicely maintained at the same time. I love the ambience, settings, and the landscape they put to the resort.  The pool was beautifully arranged in a jungle setting with a big water slide inside a form of &quot;candi&quot; And also the pool bar was nice and came with very reasonable price.  The staff, start from bell, greeter, front desk to waitstaff in the restaurant are very helpful. Shout out to Hilman &amp; Nanik from front desk and everyone I couldn&#39;t thank one by one.  Don&#39;t miss out all of their onsite activities, like golfing, fishing, and ride an &quot;andong&quot; around the resort. Also enjoy the happy hour promotion on an outdoor massage at their &quot;bale&quot;</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed 3 nights at the Hyatt Regency in Yokyakara. - Great room, great food, polite staff. The setting is what makes the place. Several pools in lush jungle-type setting provide serene relaxation. - Nice Spa. Overall, a great place to stay. "
Booked this hotel as part of our Indonesia trip as a bit of a treat after staying in hostels and budget hotels and so glad we did! The whole place is beautiful - very central but as soon as you pass through the gate to the hotel it is like a whole other world. The grounds are very well maintained and the staff were amazing - cannot fault the service we received from check in to check out. The pool and other facilities are wonderful - pool side service and the restaurant was lovely too. Relatively quiet when we stayed which was lovely. Luxury at a bargain price! And the staff were very helpful right at the last minute when our transfer (not booked through the hotel) didn&#39;t turn up - the hotel arrange alternative transport for us within minutes!
"Reliable hotel with nice garden. Overall nice service. There were 16 of us in 6 bedrooms including 8 kids. They love to just swim, relax, played pingpong, fishing. Really wonderful.  of options for breakfast"
"Rooms were nice and comfortable. There lot of food options for the breakfast buffet and even with the tax and service charges of 20%, items in the menu are reasonably priced and good quality and quantity. The front desk is very helpful and polite and so are the support staff and members of the restaurant.  Gym is too small and can&#39;t accommodate more than 5 people at ones which is not quite up to the 5 star standard. The outside seem to have a bit of a mosquito issue sometimes which cannot be helped i guess.  Some renovation will need to be undertaken. The hotel&#39;s physical appearance of an ancient building is great. But with so much wood around in the facility, it could deteriorate faster and incur losses if not careful.  Good tour desk (Angsa Tours) with lot of tour options. But</span><span>&hellip;"
"Second stay at this hotel. As before, hardware was not great but OK. Rooms were damp and noisy. Bathroom fixtures needed a renewal.  Staff service was a disaster:  (1) We had booked 2 rooms for 3 people in total. The hotel proceeded to prepare 2 rooms for 3 people *each*, adding an extra bed at extra cost. Should be easy to fix, right? Well, on arrival, we spent some 15 minutes discussing this with staff in the executive lounge (which smelled of sewage), who kept telling us that it was our mistake. Apart from the fact that is wasn&#39;t, why not just fix the issue rather than insist that the guest has to live with something that is so easily addressed? In the end, it took the duty manager to take care of something this simple.  (2) Check-in time was 14:00 hours. We were at the hotel</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights.  The property is huge with beautiful landscape surrounding the swimming pools.  The greenery around the property has also well maintained.  Staff was very helpful and accommodating.  Our small son had a great time feeding the fish at the lobby level.  They had a great Christmas party as well.  If there is one suggestion, I think they can invest a bit more and expand the ‚Äòkids club‚Äô which is actually just a small room.  But overall, we really enjoyed our stay."
Always happy to stay in hyattSpent almost a week in the hotel but never boredAlways enjoy the ambiance environment friendly staff and its good foodAlways want to go back to hyatt when i am in jogjakarta
Hotel ground was beautiful. We love the very attentive and helpful staff. They went out of their way to help us solve our logistical problem in visiting the sights. Food and spread was excellent. Room was too small for 3 persons. 
"Second visit to this hotel.Currently in the midst of a 5-night vacation stay. Wonderful natural setting, lovely architecture, good, reasonably priced food at the bistro and friendly/caring staff . That‚Äôs where the good news ends! The rooms are of 1980s vintage, bathroom fixtures are terrible, need urgent replacement/refurbishment. So far everyday, have had issues with lack of hot water in the shower, slow drains, old/malfunctioning toilets/commodes, stained bed and bath linen...not a good advertisement for the Hyatt brand! Staff are eager to please but very distracted. Was asked by waitstaff at breakfast if I wanted another latte (after he noticed I was through with first one). I said yes, but the latte never showed up! Just a small example of the indifferent service. Everybody</span><span>&hellip;"
This resort is one of the choice if staying in Yogyakarta. It still has the grandeur of the older style resort.  Positives: 1. Awesome food both breakfast and dinner. 2. Surrounded by lush greeneries throughout the complex. 3. Javanese architecture 4. Perfect for conference.  Negatives: 1. The rooms might need some facelift.
"great place, interesting event, good value of money, the staffs are friendly, the building is unique and have good ambience. the location is on the outside of jogja‚Äôs central city area. The hotel provide many interesting event.."
"We stayed 4 nights at the Hyatt Regency and enjoyed the service, grounds and wonderful pool area.   The breakfast selection was lovely with a full spectrum of Indonesian and Western fare complemented by very attentive and polite staff.  The outside Ramayana dance and night market dinner was very nice and my three hour morning bicycle tour allowed me to see the country-side and talk to people living and working outside Yogya.   A very enjoyable stay and we very much recommend the Hyatt as a place to relax and visit Yogyakarta. "
"This is about the Hyatt Regency and its extroadinary levels of service.  Yogya, or Jogja, has always been one of my favourite cities after living in Indonesia for over a decade. Now back in Singapore, I recently persuaded a group of friends to visit Jogja. Each time I visit, I try a different hotel ranging from homestays to 5 star abodes.  Hyatt Regency is just outside the city centre boasting sprawling grounds and a 9 hole golf course, friendly to children and families.  There must be something in the water they drink as ALL staff are &#39;super&#39; friendly and natural smiles greet each and every guest. No request is met with a negative response, as we found out at our breakfast buffet.  Parking my personal car near the lobby, I found that the birds had a field day of target</span><span>&hellip;"
"I really enjoy every second in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. The room, the bathroom, food, view from the hotel room, the pool, staff and everything in it is a perfect combination of a very high class comfy hotel. "
I highly recommend Hyatt Regency to everyone to stay when visit Yogyakarta. A lot of activities can be done in the hotel. The breakfast is very delicious and the swimming pool is great. The staffs also very kind and polite.
"Great hospitality and nice staffs. However, all guests rooms and amenities require urgent upgrades and face lift. Besides, food to be revise as having same dish from morning till night aren&#39;t great providing this hotel has only 1 restaurant for guests to dine in. Quality of food to be uplifted as well."
The idyllic charm of this hotel will appeal to stressed up city slickers who to reboot and revitalise their senses. The wonderful 9-hole Golf course and the Spa are irresistible! Perfect retreat in every way. 
"If you need a place to go where you can leave the worries of the world behind you, then this is absolutely the right place for you. It is so peaceful and enchanting  You really will feel your cares wash away when you walk through the door. There is a welcome drink and native flower lei presented to you. The staff are so helpful and friendly. Just beautiful, humble people who will go out of their way to make your stay the most memorable in your life. Agung is a lovely young man who looks after reception and customer relations. He is an absolute wealth of knowledge for his age. He can give you stats, award titles, names, locations and the number of rooms in just about every Hyatt Hotel across the world. I was very impressed! The meals have been exquisite. I&#39;m not kidding! The</span><span>&hellip;"
"First, let me say the staff and this hotel are truly amazing....just great all around from the staff that welcome you to the check in process, to the dining, down to those in the spa.  My husband and I came during a long weekend off work in hopes of relaxing and experiencing a bit of Indonesian culture and we got exactly what we&#39;d hoped for.  Now, full disclosure...the hotel, although great, is a bit dated. The rooms were very clean but old. The bathroom, from the fixtures to the tub were also dated but because the trip itself wasn&#39;t to be spent in the room it was ok. Overall, great staff, beautiful grounds and wonderful food (breakfast/lunch/dinner buffets SO GOOD). I would return but hopefully they will begin the updating process within a year or two...it&#39;s the only thing</span><span>&hellip;"
"I love to stay here.  it was wonderful experience. Beautiful scenery, great food, warm staff, great room and almost complete facilities.Minor feedback relates to air circulation at toilet (bathroom) and water pressure and temperature stability of shower. Improve both items may make it perfect. "
I&#39;m happy with the service of this hotel very well. The staff is very helpful and the scenery around is very beautiful. I feel at home in the hotel and even lazy to go to another place. And i will come back again here if i go to yogyakarta again.
"Had a great 4 night stay at the Hyatt Yogyakarta. Fantastic staff who took the effort to remember our names and were also eager to help. Great breakfast buffet spread with a good selection of local and international food. We upgraded to access the Executive lounge which I highly recommend for a good selection of light food and drinks in the evening. Great facilities (golf, health club, swimming pools)"
"A hotel is a hotel.  Until you experience the pool and the staff at the Hyatt Regency Yogya.  First, the pool is like having your own tropical lagoon.  It is so beautiful, I was content to just sit there most days and not deal with the heat and congestion of Yogya.  I got exercise by walking the path that surrounded the hotel.  And then the staff were the cherry on top.  So sweet, warm, wonderful.  I had an amazing stay."
"Overall is a pleasant stay with what could have been relaxing and pleasant if not the hotel is fully booked with families and children.I love kids, only I am hoping for quiet and relaxing stay.  I am not prepare to have such a full house booking."
"Very nice, clean and friendly staff with jade green golf course! Love the restaurant for Dinner, the lamps under the trees surely add a romantic touch. The location is not too far from the city center which is an added bonus"
"My experience as always, they will make you as their important guest the first you entered the lobby. Check in is quick, less annoying You can calmly seat at the lobby and enjoy the welcome drink while they busy check in your room"
"A lovely property that reminded me of the old Bali Hyatt...beautiful grounds, swimming pool, spa.  Hotel needs updating.   The service was exceptional.   I was greeted my Mr Nur in the club lounge and it was smooth sailing after that.    Yayon in the lounge was wonderful.   She was so warm, friendly, and dedicated to making the customer feel special and at home.    "
"I love the atmosphere here, really i feel in yogya with a traditonal style. Everything is great, no complaints at all. The location is perfect, full of restaurants and coffee shop nearby. The most important thing is this hotel have own style, personality and very welcome. "
I think with our globalists status at Hyatt we got amazing values out of this hotel.  Great breakfast buffet varieties (local and international)good evening lounge foods and alcoholic beverages. Kids friendly and great staffs. 
"Surrounded with thousand of green trees and having a thousand smile from the front liner staff had turn back my bad mood after having jet lag and traffic around Yogyakarta after a huge rain into a fresh mood again to start my holiday with my little family,,, Perfect impression has completed when we were getting inside our room and get a sweet surprise from the Hotel which had put a lovely Roses petal with a swan towel decoration. Another surprised is that this hotel accidentally know our favorite flower &quot;Bunga Sedap Malam&quot; and they also put it in our bedroom...(speechless)... Having a dinner with my family in the outdoor are was became a great scenario, my boy and my wife really enjoyed it because the food, the staff, and the area was perfectly match our expectation.Merapi</span><span>&hellip;"
"I had an amazing experience staying here. The hospitality is excellent, and many activities we can do in this property. You can jogging, cycling, swimming and joining the yoga class. You dont want to go out if you already here."
"Once you enter to this hotel , you see the great hospitality of the staff . They greet you with some traditional flowers which makes you feel very special.  The garden and the pool is extremely beautiful and you would wish to stay there unlimited."
"The last time I remember stayed in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta Hotel was 10 years ago with my family. This time I&#39;d like to enjoy my good weekend in a nice hotel. Hyatt Regency is an old hotel, but I need to give my warmth appreciation for the team whom work hard to keep this hotel alive and keep attractive. The hotel has been renovated since, and I could see from room interior is brand new. The location is quiet far from the city of Yogya (which I like it the most, to stay away from the crowd). The garden view is stunning! Nice to see green view when you wake up in the morning. The style of Hyatt is always keeping a warm greetings, good attention and personal approach on its guests while remaining respectful and courteous.  The room in spacious, clean, and simple homey interior</span><span>&hellip;"
"First time staying at the Hyatt Regency Jogjakarta, was recommended by a friend who enjoyed staying there before. Was very happy that I decided to stayed at Hyatt, more than I expected to be, love the swimming pool and the bicycle activity. All the Hyatt staff was very attentive."
"I have stayed here twice.  I am a Hyatt globalist so I have stayed at many Hyatts.  This is a great property to visit.  The staff treats you very well, I am not sure what happened in the reviews where anyone rated this property a 4 or less.  It is a solid 5.  I will stay here many times in the future.  Kindness and sincerity are the two adjectives that come to mind and it is very sincere.  At breakfast the chief asked me if I thought there was any way to improve his breakfast?  I could not.  Fitry the Guest Experience Manager was most accommodating.  For anyone that wants to experience Java (incredible) but still have the familiarity of the west, this is a great place to stay."
"I was amazed by the staff warmness, attention and personal approach while remaining highly respectful and courteous.  The rooms are nicely furnished and, while starting to become dated, are of good quality and finish, though some maintenance is required:  specifically, in my room, the sink tap did not work well as it continued to run a little after closing it; the blackout curtains need to be reset or hung in a way that allows overlap to block the light; the gap under the door lets a lot of light through in the night; and, as with a great many hotels, the room doors are often left to bang shut, so it would be good to see a soft-close mechanism - of course, these are not significant issues, so no major concern.  The food was very good and never left me wanting.  The communal</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed 3 nights here.  Although the resort is quite old, but well kept.  It would be much better if in room furniture and bathroom were renovated.  Swimmming pools and sliders are really cool.  The resort is quite far from city center and grocery shops, but GRAB and taxi are easy to get and inexpensive."
"Hyatt regency Yogyakarta is worth to stay. Over all is pretty good. One poor point is the location is quite far from shopping area so you have no choice but need to call the grab taxi  to travel around. But if you want to stay chill in the hotel or playing golf, I would recommend you to stay here."
"The hotel is old and needs refurbishment. This is compensated by the most wonderful staff, service and overall experience. Despite the negative comments, this is a great place to stay.The location is great, the facilities excellent and the layout of the hotel, grounds, pools, facilities, etc just wonderful."
"5 star and earns it.  Built in the bend of a golf course, this hotel is quiet, which was perfect for me after the noise of Kuta in Bali.  Site is very attractive, lushly designed, and well groomed; has nice walking trail protected from vehicles.  Everything worked properly [bit rare in less than 5 star places in Indonesia and even some 5 star places].  Staff were everywhere and very courteous.  Excellent buffet breakfast with many Indonesian dishes; selection changed daily.  [All halal, of course.]  Choice of indoor or outdoor seating.  {I did suggest to management that the chef&#39;s take on Mexican dishes and barbeque were not authentic.  Choose Indonesian foods and you&#39;ll not go wrong.}"
"It&#39;s been almost 10 years since we last stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta.  This hotel is as wonderful as I remember it.  We brought my parents along this time.  My father, who has traveled all of his life, said that the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is &#39;simply the nicest hotel I&#39;ve ever stayed at.&#39;"
"We were very impressed with the attentive staff and family friendly environment for such a nice hotel! Our kids loved the spacious pool, water slide, sand box, &amp; delicious food! Absolutely great weekend-we look forward to going again in the near future."
"Spent two lovely nights at this hotel early in October, we were warmly welcomed by the friendly and helpful staff even though we were early and our rooms were not yet ready.  We had a delicious lunch in the main restaurant before attending an afternoon work event in the function rooms.  We had club access throughout our stay and attended each afternoon for cocktails and canapes - great variety with chef on hand to cook up various soups and other dishes.  An early morning swim and walk around the beautiful gardens was a great way to start the day.  The breakfast buffet has so many choices, there is definitely something for everyone. Our room was clean and well appointed with a lovely outlook over the gardens to the golf course.  The gym does not have a bike but I am told it is</span><span>&hellip;"
"While my friend and I stayed at the hotel. There were a couple of conferences going on. We felt like we were a second class guest as we could not use the outdoor area of the restaurant due to the group of people from the conferences. So, we were placed in a very dark area with a big amount of mosquitoes instead.   The hotel pool opens 24 hrs but when we were there around 6.30 PM and already dark, the swimming pool light has not lid up even one! and also no light for stairs to the pool at all. So, I had to use flashlight from my phone instead in order to see the floor.   Restaurant, limited menu and also wine list. The taste is average.   The staffs are friendly, helpful, and polite. My room was clean and neat. WiFi is somehow quite slow."
"This is simply one of the very best hotels we have encountered anywhere in the world.  It combines wonderfully attentive employees, outstanding architecture and workmanship and unusual, interesting art that is in evidence everywhere.  The meals, whether Indonesia or Western cuisine, are done to perfection.  The rooms are impeccable with a touch of Art Deco that provides a special flair. The grounds that include a golf course are extensive providing a cocoon of privacy within Jogjakarta, a bustling city of three million inhabitants.  It is an oasis of perfection.  "
"Two nights stay with a big group of people from the company i work for. Have been few times before years ago, Service is average, wifi is desperately very very slow - almost nothing. Have checked with other colleagues and they experienced the same. I‚Äôve raised this complaint to the front desk, but no folliw up to check. Instead they were defensive. "
"This is the one of recommended hotel in Jogja. It used tranditional concepts here. It has some miniature temple, statue, swimming pool. The food &amp; beverage here is also delicious. Very recommended if you want to enjoy hotel fasilities in holiday."
"I stayed at the Hyatt as this was the recommended place to stay for a business visit. The grounds were stunning, the service was exemplary and the sleep quality was 100%. I would love to come back and stay again."
"A beautiful property away from the crowded city of yogyakarta, has a very scenic surrounding and a view of mount Merapi. The rooms are very comfortable and resturant situated in a very strategic point where you get a full view of the landscape around. Helpful staff and a great choice of food . added attraction is a complimentary ride to the town and back!"
"We have stayed at the Hyatt Yogya once every year for the past 10+ years and have never been even slightly disappointed.  Staff is very friendly and professional in all functions from the well appointed Club Room to the excellent Spa.  Facility is very good, the pool is outstanding.  Food and beverage is also very good.  If in Yogya, you cannot go wrong with the Hyatt.,"
"This hotel was one of the best i have been too so far. We booked it with a discount incl breakfast and for all the service that we got this was exceptional good!!! Breakfast was like going to a party, there was so much to choose from and everything tasted great. The staff always smiling and greeting, the complimentery fruit at the room. The hotel location was also beautiful, surrounded by a gardens and pools. As for going to see the surroundings, borobudur, city center, malls it is also a good location to be at your holiday! Well recommended. "
"From reading some reviews on Trip Advisor I had expected a tired and dated hotel - but not at all.  We stayed 5 nights and had a relaxing stay.  The location isn&#39;t central, but the free shuttle takes 20-25mins to cover the 7km, depending on the traffic (which is normally very busy).  The staff were great, very attentive and welcoming - even remembering our names among the 100s of guests.  Buffet breakfast was well worth the 10AUD per person, a huge selection and all fresh and tasty, catering for every dietary requirement. Rooms were comfortable and the Regency Club extras were good value.  The pool is very large and the gardens are well maintained.  One night there was a large birthday party and a wedding at the hotel, but neither caused any issues for normal guests.  I would</span><span>&hellip;"
Second stay and really satisfied. Even better. Everything&#39;s amazing. The staff are friendly and professional as usual. The Regency Club make it a perfect stay. The kids also enjoyed the hotel facilities. 
"Awful breakfast disappointed me, such messy tables, bad egg dish cooked by amateur cook, bad smell coffee, not enough continental foods...I think the hotel policy has been changed. HYATT YOGYAKARTA is not a luxury hotel anymore..."
"nice garden, great staff who always remember me, near malioboro.helpfull staff when i need tradional drink for my healt and it fully free.room is quiet good even need more little renovation, but clean enough"
"staying here with my entire family, all of them really enjoyed and liking the hotel. wonderful stay from the time we are landing, check in until we drop off back to the airport. the hotel is remind me of the grand Hyatt bali property with lush and huge garden surrounding with traditional touch. the club lounge spread is good enough and the staff is really helpful. the breakfast spread is another great touch with many local cuisine they offered, tough i am not able to try each of it since way too much for myself.   however, i do understand the hotel is stand for many years and i do really feel everything inside the hotel is outdated - speaking about the design and interior the restaurant and rooms (the spa, sauna and gym room i think is way too dark and not enough sunlight.</span><span>&hellip;"
"We had an awesome stay in this hotel. My highlights were the food, specially breakfast and a la carte lunch and dinner. We also had great food and cultural experience when we attended on Saturday a presentation of Ramayana Ballet/Music with Indonesian Food. Their swim pool was also great, specially the slide where kids had a lot of fun. Rooms were clean and their staff is very helpful and supportive. Kudos for Ana from the restaurant staff, who was extremely helpful in explaining us the food and the special dinners at night. She made our family experience at Hyatt a great one. Spa infrastructure was good, with sauna and cold/hot bathtub. Highlight was Javanese massage, which I strongly recommend."
"Staying at this beautiful property for 4 days 3 night. The hotel is outdated (please look into possibility for renovations) yet, their charmed and professionalism of their staff does exist and that is make this hotel still good comparing with other resort alike hotel in the city.Breakfast choices is well spread and taste great. The food in club lounge also tasty and enough choices as well as in their main restaurant. In my opinion, the hotel is well worthy as my choice during me and my family vacation. And definitely will coming back for more in the future. "
"Overall a good experience but needs to offer more services in terms of food, activities and ambience. The staff was extremely pleasant. The Spa facility should be 24 hrs as guests tend to come back to the hotel late at night after business dinners or sightseeing."
"Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip. Room was old, as well as the bathtub. But highlight was the outdoor breakfast at 7am, with fresh air and natural surroundings. Breakfast was good, with a lot of variation. Fish pond at the entrance gave a nice touch, where we could feed the fish. Hyatt offered complimentary cycling activity too."
"An exceptional hotel demanding a return visit. Very highly recommended.   Pros:  Awesome, friendly and approachable staff. Excellent food; even for breakfast buffet.  Picturesque landscape with pools and golf course that makes you forget you are actually in Yogja.   Cons:  The rooms, though clean, are somewhat outdated and need a refresh."
"My partner and I enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a lovely hotel with beautiful gardens and a friendly, helpful staff.  The hotel is quite a distance from the center of Jogja and traffic is sometimes a bit of a problem but once you get to the hotel, it really is a very peaceful, relaxing place to stay.  The check-in was easy and the young lady who dealt with us was charming with a bubbly, friendly personality.  The room we were given wasn&#39;t particularly nice with very dirty windows and not much of a view so we asked to see a few other rooms and eventually opted to stay in one of their Club rooms on the ground floor, directly underneath the Club Lounge (Room110). The rooms was spacious and had a</span><span>&hellip;"
"What a wonderful hotel! Set in lush tropical gardens with views of the volcano, the Hyatt is standing the test of time. The rooms are spotlessly clean and the staff are fabulous; always smiling and willing to do everything they can to help. We loved the food, the pool, the relaxed atmosphere and all the little extras- fishing in the pond and a pony cart ride made Mr 6 yrs trip. Great base for exploring the area, we stayed a week and could have spent a month. Loved it!"
"A group of 15 of us stayed here for four nights  from 3.9.18 to 7.9.18. My wife and I stayed in Room 338. The staff were friendly but not helpful. Our room‚Äôs hair dryer had cold air only and the telephone near our bedside was not ringing. We requested morning call. I informed the receptionist about it. They were super nice but nothing was done. We had no hair dryer for four nights. It was really hard for me without as it is my hobbit to wash my hair every night and always late at night. The television was not working properly. Luckily the room was quite clean but unfortunately it was too old. The bathtub was old, narrow and deep. There was no separate shower. So we had to stand inside the tub and had shower. One of our friends tripped and fell head down when he was getting out</span><span>&hellip;"
It&#39;s located in near center of Yogyakarta so I could go anywhere easily. The atmosphere was good enough so I felt comfort during my stay over there. Large rooms were clean and super luxurious.staff were very helpfull. Breakfast menu very delicious.  I really enjoyed stay here.i will be back again next time. Cheers !
"I have stayed here with my family for a long weekend and all that i can say is we had a wonderful weekend and definitely love to be back when i visit the city again in the future. The staffs were absolutely warm and had a genuine smile. The rooms are quite classic but in a very good condition, the breakfast is awesome (you might want to spend a little bit more time during breakfast) because it is just beside the main pool with a wide variety of food. We love spending time by the pool and enjoy ourselves playing on the waterside and table tennis, the hotel is also not far from the city center and airport make it a very strategic location. Very recommended!!"
"Excellent hotel. The garden is gorgeous, the pools are beautiful, the room is clean and adequate, staff are extremely friendly, and the breakfast is excellent. I and my friends really love this hotel and do not want to leave. If I come back to this city again, I would not want to go anywhere else."
We have stayed at the Hyatt Regency many times and it never fails to meet and exceed our expectations. The staff are helpful and make every effort to make you feel included relaxed and comfortable. Nothing is too much trouble. Without exception they are all wonderful people. The setting is very beautiful with park-like grounds blending into a wonderfully manicured golf course and swimming pool complex. Restaurant food is excellent and service extremely good. The club lounge provides a lovely quiet oasis and the staff do everything to make you feel like family. Leaving is always tinged with sadness.
"I have not been in Jakarta of which people say is even more chaos than Yogyakarta. But I found Yogya already pretty busy. Staying in Hyatt makes it a very pleasant combination.  Service was sometimes a little poor/ chaotic/ not what I‚Äôm used to as an European, but always very very friendly and helpful.  A few tips:  - check out Bogeys - the sauna is without charge  - be extra polite and grateful to Fitri and she will be your best buddy in Yogya"
"Have stayed here several times in the last 10 years and I must say, it really is time for a refurb. The rooms are getting very worn, the curtains must be original and while they obviously were luxury once upon a time, they are falling apart now. The Club Lounge really needs some decent offerings, BUT the service was the best. And in typical Hyatt style, the service throughout the hotel was as good as it gets. Seeing so many staff interacting with guests, without sacrificing service, is heartening. But owners, do your staff a favour and give them a hotel that matches their amazing service."
"The best weekend escape in JOG. This is my 2nd time to stay at the resort. I have always feel home here. The resort landscape is a great translation of local culture. Don&#39;t get deceived by the new other glittering hotel buildings. This hotel representing jogja culture into their service to keep up  with the &quot;old fashioned&quot; resort facilities. But everything still works well. The swimming pool is very relaxing and the poolside is a great place to have breakfast . And the neighbourhood is surrounded by great eatery place from a humble French p√¢tisserie (cinema patisserie) , celebrity owned coffee shop (filosofi coffee) , a hip coffee roaster to the (epic coffee) to the Obama&#39;s visited restaurant (sasanti) "
"I stayed two nights in August. Actually only one full day, since it was evening arrival to early morning departure. A trip to Borubudur and the other sights. The hotel reflects the Borubudur style in a beautiful way, The pool area is remarkable. If it is not crowded you can feel like Indiana Jones.  From check-in to departure all was pleasant. On Thursday night there was reception close to the golf area instead of cocktails&amp;canapes in the lounge. There was music in nice surroundings and it was extremely pleasant.  I hope to be able to come back."
"We were lucky enough to stay at the Hyatt Regency for a few days as our base for visiting nearby Borobudur. The hotel is a haven of tranquility although close by to the hustle and bustle of Yogya. The huge grounds are beautifully landscaped and the hotel itself is very attractively designed taking a cue from the historic temples nearby. Our room on the 4th floor had a stunning garden view and was a good size. The design was pleasing and traditional.  We particularly enjoyed our breakfast on the wonderful terrace. Plenty of choice and delicious food. Finally I have to thank the friendly yet very professional staff, every single one we met was cheerful while doing an efficient job. Well done Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta! "
"My mother &amp; I decided to stay there for 1 night only, to attend a wedding party (last week). The hotel is situated outside Yogyakarta town, but in a dense populated area. We saw many small houses, shops and restaurants (warung) along the Palagan street. The hotel building was &quot;hidden&quot;, we didn&#39;t realize there was a huge hotel behind those small buildings.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a very nice FO staff, Miss Fajar. She handled our check in process promptly that we just sat at the lobby for 5 minutes and -voila- our room keys were handed to us. She also accompanied us to our room. We got a free upgrade so we luckily stayed in a deluxe room.  The room, the bathroom, the closet/wardrobe were very spacious. The furniture was all wooden &amp; not modern. The balcony was big,</span><span>&hellip;"
"During our stay, 3 days out of 4, the hotel was busy with private events (weddings). We could not enjoy the pool and outdoor aeras peacefully while staff was testing sound and rehearsing for their music show around us. Furniture in the room was outdated and bathroom was in a poor state (old equipement). Gym was dirty and undersized. Staff was nice and helpfull though. Food was good but service was very long. "
"Beautiful hotel, excellent service. A must go in Yogyakarta. Next time, we&#39;ll be staying much longer in Hyatt Regency. We&#39;ll be glad to recommend Yogya Hyatt to all of our friends. Good value for a genuine 5 stars."
"We stayed at the Hyatt for 3 nights during our visit to Jogja. The hotel was beautiful and very luxurious. The staff were amazing, so friendly and helpful. We ate here a few times too and the food was very tasty. Would definitely stay here again!"
Staff make you feel very welcome. The facilities are good - wished I had more time to try the golf course.Food has a great selection for breakfast and lunch. Buffet dinner was good too.Rooms are not big but well fitted out. Bathrooms are a bit tired.Overall great hotel and interesting local design. 
"Yogyakarta popularly know as Jogja is an ideal getaway for long weekends and I strongly recommend  Hyatt Regency as the place to stay.  The staff are extremely friendly, service oriented and pampering at its best. The property / resort is a beat away the city but comes with wide range of amenities including Golf, Spa, Jogging &amp; cycling Tracks, Horse Cart Rides to mention some.   Don‚Äôt miss there cooking lessons and cycling trip to the paddy fields  "
"Simply put, the HR Yogyakarta is an absolute must visit! I feel torn writing such wonderful things about his hotel and staff that will likely cause others to go, and they in turn, will cause even more people to visit because I selfishly, do not want it to change in any way, shape or form as to me it is a perfect respite. We hope to visit every year because of how wonderfully we were treated and are fearful of it becoming to overcrowed in the future as I think anyone who visits once will come back in the future, simply because the experience is that great!"
"Great place to stay with great hospitality and delicious food. The warm welcome during check-in is very special, each of us got a jasmine flower necklace. There are plenty of activities to do on site. "
"A great hotel for family holiday. We stayed 5 nights at the Hyatt while visiting the surrounding sites. The hotel has amazing grounds, very relaxing after a long day on the road.The swimming pool is large with a slide for the kids (the water is very cold though) and there is also golf and tennis. Very friendly staff. Easy shuttle bus of ca 20 mins into the city centre. Highly Recommended! "
"21 years old resort. Staff had full of smile in everywhere we go in the resort. Everyone call us with our last name. We could relax and enjoy the stay.  We stayed in the suite which has 180 degree view to the mountains and gold course. Foods were good. Room was relatively clean. My wife had the fever, and they took care of her personally. The doctor told us that she may have the dengue disease and we went to the emergency to check her blood. The resort sent the staff with us. He was excellent to take care of us for 2 hours at a hospital ER. Fortunately, the result was negativehe. We had the hotel car for batik shopping. The driver knew the good batik shops well. We will stay this resort in July 2019 again.   "
"One of the best hotels our family have ever stayed in for many reasons. As soon as you arrive you are greeted with smiles and friendly staff, quick process of checking in.   Facilities available are: Complimentary horse and cart ride around the resort daily.  Complimentary different health drink at reception, as much as you want to drink, as well as a local healthy ginger sweets (good for sore throats).  Large swimming pool with a great long 53 m slide, next to this Whirlpool. In a separate building Sauna, Jacuzzi, cold water plunge, all with excellent facilities---toilets, shower (with conditioner and shampoo), sinks, cotton wool and cotton buds, clean towels provided, drinking water dispenser, lockers with keys, etc. Football---with ball provided. Tennis---have to pay small</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel was sublimely decorated, with staff that were eager to please in any way. While the rooms themselves were slightly underwhelming in terms of the condition of the furniture and furnishings, they were kept exceedingly clean; the complimentary sweets, cookies and fruit basket were also a delightful surprise. With good value for money as well, I would not hesitate returning for another stay with the Hyatt."
"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta during a recent vacation to Indonesia and were incredibly impressed by everything, but most especially the peacefulness of the surroundings and the kindness of the staff. The hotel is like an island of luxury in the middle of Yogyakarta. We stayed for three nights and opted to pay for &quot;Executive&quot; level access, which meant that we had use of the executive lounge and it&#39;s excellent (free) happy hour each evening. Our room was spacious and comfortable with all the amenities you could ask for -- including robes that could be worn to the pool. The breakfast buffet was one of the largest and most comprehensive I&#39;ve ever seen, with delicious asian and western offerings. You could enjoy lunch poolside or at the hotel restaurant. We also enjoyed</span><span>&hellip;"
"First, I have to say how wonderful the whole staff is at this hotel. Hyatt usually has pretty good customer service to begin with, but this hotel is above and beyond anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. More people than I can count approached us just to have a nice conversation. Every conversation left us more and more excited about being in Jogja because everyone was clearly very proud to live/be a part of the area. Every hotel could learn from this staff.   Apart from the fantastic staff, the hotel had a lot to offer. The outdoor part of the property is beautiful and serene with a lovely walk/jog trail, golf course, and pool. I usually don‚Äôt like organized tours but strongly recommend the rice field bike ride for only 150k per person. Our guide was great-very informative and</span><span>&hellip;"
We spent 4 nights here and everything was amazing. The hotel is beautiful and the room is such a wonderful comfy place for you to get back after a whole day exploring the city. The service staff is so so friendly and accommodating!  Highly recommended! We will surely come back!
it was a beautiull and relaxing stay here at hyat.thanks i choosed hyat over marriat and will recommend also to choose hyat....every thing is so perfect here.it just connects u wth old times in a modern way
"Just a 4D3N stay with young child. Suitable. Pool with slide was excellent fun. Ramanaya Night Market buffet dinner and performance is a must. Standard room is clean and comfortable enough for 3. Staff were amazing. Made us feel at home. And not just one or two staff members who stood out, but 5-6, from front desk, to restaurant to even the housekeeping technician who came to fix a broken water closet at around 10pm within minutes of being requested."
"Wonderful hotel providing warm service by caring staff.  Feels like being in paradise, just minutes away from busy city.  Experience a traditional setting with local and western food, refreshing swimming pool with poolside food and drink service, enjoy a quick round of golf at the onsite executive golf course, or an outdoor relaxing massage."
"Stayed here for 5nights with 2 kids and my parent, they pamperred us and make the   holiday even feels better. They give us yummy cookies in our room, fresh fruits and clean bedroom everyday, staff always smile and greet us by name. They asked for new breakfast menu just in case we get bored and make sure everything went okay, special thanks to mbak Sri . And We really really love the green scenery around the hotel. We tried the facilities from jogging track, andong tour around the hotel, table tennis to driving golf. The fishing pond is the best attraction for my kids, they always spent their morning and evening by fishing. The pool is beautiful and also fun with slide. Def will come back to this hotel."
Extremely friendly staff. Great pool and park. Nice terrace for breakfast and dinner. Excellent breakfast buffet. Tours to temples etc. can be booked at the reception. Convenient free shuttle to the city. We enjoyed our stay. 
"This is just out of this world. From the staff at the arrival area right up to the GM, there is no comparison when one travels to Yogyakarta(Jogja as the Indonesians call it). The service, facility, food( a full variety for any world traveler), the tranquility, the athletic opportunities, and the pool are miles above any other hotel in the city. It is perfect for families, seniors, and couples looking for a romantic experience. We have stayed there for about 10 years in a row. Almost all the staff is bilingual ( speaking English), and they remember our names as we arrive at the arrival area which is amazing! Everyone is treated like and made to feel like a VIP. They also offer a free shuttle service to and from the famous shopping area Malioboro Street. This hotel is in a class</span><span>&hellip;"
"Even it is 5* hotel people with average income can afford it. I was realy enjoying there. It has beautiful swimming pool area, so meny different types of food for breakfast. But I was unsatisfied with gym, it is small and dirty, especialy showers and toilet there."
"My15y/o daughter and I needed somewhere to stay whilst visiting friends locally. We received a typically warm Yogya greeting up on arrival. That warmth never faltered during our 3 days at the hotel. The outdoor breakfasts were wonderful as were the 2 buffet dinners we had under the extensive tree canopy and fairy lights. My daughter was entranced and I was reminded of why I loved Indonesia. The Ramayana Ballet was of the highest quality and the warung makan style of buffet food was a triumph. My one comment is that more fruit,  better displayed at breakfast would have been lovely. Thank you to all the stuff. 10/10"
"Had to make few phone calls, complain and finally asked for a manager so they could figure it out my reservation was as a GOH.  Very frustrating and dissatisfaction actually. The first impression and interactions with the staff ( specially the ladies from the lounge) was not good. At the end it got resolved, after having to contact Hyatt media team, front desk, lounge, and finally get a manager involved. Crazy! First time this ever happened to us as GOH. "
"Excellent location, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Very peaceful environments with exceptional service. Yogyakarta Hyatt has all the modern amenities, comfortable bed with fresh linen and pillow choices. Breakfast with multiple choices, juices,smoothies, fresh fruits, local and western hot and cold dishes. The restaurant offers a variety of regional foods alongside western cuisine."
"Great character amid lush greenery, very peaceful and relaxing. No need to leave the hotel at all, with so many facilities. The landscaping and layout is incredible, and when feels like your own private mansion whenever you are lucky enough to stay during the off-season. I have been coming back for 5 years, and always feel recharged."
"The staff was great, and the manager was very accommodating despite not being able to give us the supposedly better corporate rate. We checked-in late, so they gave us a later check-out time, which was excellent and above and beyond especially with the later flight time we had scheduled. The kids had a lot of fun and we didn&#39;t have to go far. There was a lot to do, and we are definitely headed back again next time we&#39;re in town. "
First we start off with how welcoming the atmosphere and the staff were in the hotel and upon arrival we were given cold face towels and a welcoming drink which was delicious! The room was certainly way above our expectation and it was neat and clean. The overall experience of staying in Hyatt was amazing.
"I stayed at this hotel in order to attend a seminar at the University Gajah Mada. I chose this hotel based on the recommendation of the organizing committee of the seminar. Staying at this hotel was very pleasant.  There is a jogging track, a swimming pool, a small forest, a few temples, and several small ponds around the hotel. Breakfast is superb, the food is delicious, the staff is very friendly and professional. If you want to just relax and want to spend your time in the hotel, there are many activities that can be done : walking or jogging in the park surrounding the hotel, swimming, taking photograph, or relaxing in the large hotel lobby with piano player and singer with beautiful and melodious voice. The hotel is also suitable for families with children. "
"this hotel is an wide are because it was incl the golf course, very homy and tranquil, if you have breakfast suggest in out door area, and try the fried snacks also the waffle. on Saturday there are ramayana show... have a nice day in jogja"
Thank you to the team at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. Very special place and it has magic. Will be back and you really should stay there if you like charm and a team that loves to take care of guests. Amazing place.... 
"Summary : Yup! The title is the first thing I said when entering this large and majestic hotel (or resort). Shady trees with large bole, making it as if we were in the middle of a jungle. From the entrance we could see a reception area surounded by fish pond, where at this stage it divides the hotel into two section, left wing is the hotel room building and on the right is the ballroom, club house and golf area. From the reception area we could see green expanse of the golf course. I would say humongous!  Sometimes you can tell the age of a hotel from its passenger lift, and this is also (CMIIW) one of the oldest hotel in Jogja. But, since Hyatt is the name, luxury still attached to this hotel. Our room is &#39;standard&#39; type yet spacious. The day we&#39;re checking-in coincide with my</span><span>&hellip;"
"We were booked into Hyatt for 2 nights by our travel agent. The room was very small, with taps that leaked. the gym very basic with no floor mats for exercise. The food was quite average too.  The hotel needs to be renovated with better facilities."
"Comfortable stay, wonderful tropical landscape, and good assist from the hotel to visit the most famous temples and places in Jogjakarta. In spite of some stains on the furniture, and renovation is recommended for rooms. However, the staff and housekeeping response was perfectly positive for any maintenance. "
"My kids, wife, and I stayed over a weekend. We were very impressed with the hotel. It was great value for the money. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with our kids. The room was great although the bathroom appointments are somewhat dated. The traditional buffet with an artistic show on Saturday night was exceptional. The only thing we found below standard was the breakfast buffet. The service at the buffet was very good but the food offerings were slightly lacking. Overall a fantastic stay and very good value for the money. We will go back again."
"First experience to stay at hyatt hotel. View, foods, staff everything are good and nice. Can ridin a delman and swim at the pool. Breakfast all good. And its like inside the forest coz its so many trees  "
"Nice enough for exspensive hotel ,  gorgeous View from the hotel room we stay in the 6th floor. I can spend my self for a long time there. Good restaurant, yummy nice food... very friendly staff.  A little bit far from the center. They have traditional dance in the evening, nice dinner also! "
"I am completely disappointed with unprofessional staff and services that I got during my stayed in your hotel. The facts of a five Stars hotel with quite high demand price cannot give a proper service like all people expected.   I have been traveling almost half of the world and stayed in five Stars hotel (often) and this is the first worst five Stars I ever stayed in.   I do loved the foods that your talented chefs made, amazing view, great garden view, great room, polite room service attendance but worst services from your front office area. It is so shamed that a front office which a people who supposed to be understand (fully) about the hotel better than others cannot deliver a perfect yet outstanding service, a lacked of communication yet informations that has been given to</span><span>&hellip;"
"Needs renovation. I understand it&#39;s 24 years old and it shows in the guest rooms. Poor maintenance and up keep. The staff worked hard to say how much they care, but then kept getting it wrong. A little weird. "
"Since 1997 until now, I always love to make a stay at this hotel. In 1997 it was a magnificent hotel, but now it is kind of old fashioned hotel. Despite of that, I still in love with this hotel, maybe it always reminds me of the childhood memories spent at this property. The hotel is very green, and I always love to have a room with a balcony to the garden.  Do not expect fancy from the room, because it already passed 20 years of time. My recommendation is to take an alfresco dinner by the pool, always love the dim light atmosphere of it."
We loved our stay there. Stayed for 5 nights. The staff were great from day one till our departure. They took good care of our special dietary(vegetarian) needs. Hotel location is good. 4 km or so from busy city centre but shuttle service is great. Hotel compound is awesome and gives u feeling of being in a remote location. 
I used to stay in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta as my place of choice for years. It is sad to see that the rooms are very outdated and under-maintained with a smell of mold. With so many new hotel options in Yogyakarta if Hyatt wants to keep its loyal customer this needs to be done ASAP. I see a construction of gym and new facilities taking place but the core- customers rooms remaining the weakest point even for VIP guests. I see in other reviews that management promised this to be addressed early 2018 but still nothing happening. Maybe Hyatt needs to put a solid management in place if it it wants to retain its branding. Too many dissatisfied customers for Hyatt brand. Sad.
Hyatt Jogja never disappoints me. I really love the hotel&#39;s surroundings. Feels like in the forest. The Koi pond and the garden are very well-maintained. All staffs are very attentive and polite.   Clean bedroom. Comfortable mattress. Delicious breakfast (try the Lava Egg Merapi).  Great spa service!
Very clean rooms. Very friendly personal. Super service and you get advises for your sightseeing trips from well and informed persons in this house. And it gives an hourly shuttle service to the city and back. 
"Stayed for 5D4N for business. I love everything in Hyatt but the room. I experienced good things here.  All services were good. The foods were good. The pool is the best, big pool with pleasant views sorroundings.   The room was small but there was clean and nice bathroom (bath tub). It is recommended for you to ask the room view (I got garden views which is good). Ask for iron if you need it (extra charge).   No more to say, I cant describe my pleasant stay with words. Just try and experience it.   For more tips: even the hotel is not located in the heart of city but it is still good for you to enjoy sorroundings culinary."
"Stayed there for 3 nights and was greeted by the Duty Manager upon check in.   The hotel has a very nice facilities including gym, swimming pool, sauna, and good restaurant.   The room was clean, tidy, neat and spacious. The staff was very helpful and friendly.   I would strongly recommend their restaurant. They served really nice authentic Indonesian cuisine. You can have variety Indonesian dishes at reasonable price.   I would recommend this hotel for your trip to Yogyakarta."
"With beautiful grounds that reminds me of the old hyatt in sanur.. this place is like a little haven .. nice over grown trees that gives u that tropical resort feel, beautiful and nice smiles from the staff (they are ever willing to help make your stay awesome) stayed at the regent floor or the club rooms.. with evening cocktails and a closer way to the pool..  breakfast was great.. spa staff were nice( they were constantly full) tried a 2 and half hour Javanese treatment that was just bliss.. only thing i would recommend is to have 1 segment of the swimming pool to be adult only for adults who would like a bit more quite pool time in this lovely resort.. a must must stay"
"Wow, such a beautiful hotel! Around 20 minutes drive to the city centre. Located next to the golf course, which makes that almost every room has a beautiful (garden) view. The swimming pool is what makes this hotel so special. Food is rather expensive for Indonesian standards, but good quality. The buffet however is worth every penny: 120.000 rupiah per person. Super friendly staff. I would definitely return!"
"A somewhat aging hotel property this one is.  It is in the Balinese style of the latr Made Wijaya - lush greenery, nice water plays, nature, stone carvings, nature, and more water - it works!!!  Also, the hotel team is trying really hard to make sure that you enjoy your stay...  In a nutshell, an aging property, in a relatively tough location, saved by the commitment of the team, and some great Bali inspired architecture and rough-n-reafy landscape design."
"271/5000 We stayed for a total of 4 nights in this hotel. The service was very good and not intrusive. Above all, we can recommend the restaurant / bistro. We thought it was a pity that breakfast had to be booked extra. The muezins have unfortunately annoyed us extremely."
"Staff at the hotel were polite and helpful, ensuring that I feel right at home the moment I arrived. The hotel&#39;s surrounding is nice and food is available 24hrs (in-room dining). Location is also not too bad, being about 20-30mins away from the airport, depending on the traffic."
"Location: Although Hyatt Regency is not in Jogja city center, it is a true serenity. It is very easy to go to Malioboro street and tourists attractions either by Grab (never wait more than 5 minutes) or hourly free shuttle.   Room: it was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but we have great view of the golf course. Bed and pillows are super comfortable. Sufficient amenities provided.   Facilities: beautiful big pool with long slider. Poolside are quite nice to just laid down after a long day. Pool towel provided. Enough lounge chair by the pool for everyone. Spa is in good setting and my therapist, Inga, was amazing.   Staffs: all staffs, I really mean all, are very nice and helpful. We lost sunglasses in Grab car and realized when we had lunch at the restaurant, the</span><span>&hellip;"
"I wanted to give this hotel the benefit of the doubt, 4 stars, why: very affordable for a Hyatt hotel at 70 euro for a standard room,  great pool area with two slides, extensive and good quality breakfast options, both Asian and European, special Merapi egg signature dish, friendly staff, and we were lucky to get an upgrade to a regency room.  Why I doubt, inefficient check in, you are asked to take a seat and then it takes 10-15 minutes before they check you in, ridiculous expensive laundry, 25 euro for 8 t shirts (my mistake, should have checked upfront), dinner options, both the special Saturday buffet as well as a la carte the other day, below average (strange as breakfast is really good), at bogey restaurant had to pay twice the amount that was on menu for the satay as they</span><span>&hellip;"
"First of all, i will to thank Ruth from Hyatt to make great arrangements for 25 of us. Fitry for providing excellent services throughout our stay. We are very happy with the rooms. Your massage is definitely one of the best i have tried. Enjoyed our stay amd lookig forward to stay here again."
"Lots of lily when entering lobby, very nice atmosphere, swimming pool is great, food is delicious. Friendly staff, very responsive and they treat me like i am a vip guest :) . Definitely will come back!"
"Great atmosphere: it&#39;s a corner of heaven to relax and rest after long tours to Prambanan, Borobodur and city center!!! Absolutely recommended - including great breakfast and a very nice atmosphere for a beer or a dinner in the evening!"
"My husband and I stay here for 3 nights, we enjoy the hospitality  from the hotel staff, good breakfast and beautiful garden surround the hotel. We can see Mount Merapi from the garden.  this garden is very famous for outdoor wedding celebration in Yogya.  The hotel room is nice and clean, but quite small for us. The hotel also provide free shuttle to Malioboro every 2 hour. Very recommended for leisure and relax...a short getaway from business and routine day to day work."
"Overall good for room, food, customer service and iam enjoy it Next trip maybe will recommended for visit to  hyatt For cleaning good and location romantic in country Thank you for service and overall."
"We loved our recent 4 day stay here.  There are so many activities for active kids.  They loved the extensive green spaces, large pool, waterslide, horse and buggy ride, bird avery and mostly....the fishing!!!  Our 4 year old was obsessed, from sun up to sun down, fishing, fishing, fishing.  The menu and buffet variety was just fine for us, and well priced.  A good range of local and western dishes for kids and adults. Additionally the other strength of this hotel is it staff!  They were always helpful, smiling and remembered the kids names at each encounter.  Agreed with previous comments that this resort needs improved maintenance and a make over.  The rooms are a good size and well appointed and comfortable, but are a little dated.  We really appreciated adjoining nonsmoking</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel has several positive points: pool, entrance lobby are very nice. It is in the middle of amazing greenery. Staff is very welcoming and really they do big effort, congratulations to management for how they are keeping the level of service high. Problem is the hotel is old, especially rooms need to be renovated. F&amp;B needs to be strengthen for both equipment/facilities and food offer. Golf course for instance is for practise, not for expert they want a proper course. Position is not really strategic, it is near to anything. Anyway this is a place where in few days i saw many  weddings, this means the locations is really important."
"Came back here after a long time for a 2 night stay. Despite being an older property now, the premises for me are still excellent and impressive. All we experienced was well maintained, very clean and working. The rooms are not of the latest design anymore and a bit small compared to more modern offerings. Worth to mention is the quiet and efficient air conditioning. Personnel we experienced to be friendly and attentive. Convenient access to the adjacent Golf course. Food was ok, but not exciting. Gardens I felt were not perfectly cared of. Hotel was very crowded at the time of visiting. That probably explains those little downers.  Overall a very pleasing experience. I will definitely return.  "
"great location, and most important their staff.  Myself and group of  5 friends were very impressed by Hyatt&#39;s team, especially Dilita, Fernanda, Nathan, Meiryna and Yani.  Even at golf the next day we were treated with welcoming arms."
"One of, if not the best, I&#39;ve stayed at. Service is absolutely world-class. Breathtaking design and landscaping. The room was clean with classy decor. One gripe was the rust and wear on the bathtub drain and the stains on the bedsheets; which isn&#39;t that big of a deal considering how clean and well taken care the rooms are.   This is the one hotel where i wouldn&#39;t mind staying in the whole day relaxing and enjoying the facilities. The jogging path around the hotel was peaceful and tranquil. Didn&#39;t manage to have any of the breakfast buffet but i loved the food, especially the banana fritter.   In its entirety, the outstanding service and hospitality provided by the staff is commendable and this is what brings me back."
wow experiece.. this is my first experience stay in hotel when i wake up in the morning go (direct) to the tee box and  start play golf. Good fairway.... friendly golf staff and caddy.  Good Breakfast..  you have various omlet
"There were 3 of us who were there for work and we had a meeting on the buffet area during lunch. The weather was scorching hot but the trees kept us from getting sunburn. I think this hotel is excellent especially if you take a walk in the morning to explore the gardens, you&#39;ll get nice photos. Room was very clean, we stayed in smoking rooms and must confess that they did excellent job on keeping the rooms not smelling like ashtray and the best part is that they have balconies so we can sit and smoke outside enjoying the fresh air."
"We stayed one night during a group shore excursion to visit Borodobur.  Check in was easy and the room was comfortable.  The outside areas are lovely, and the buffet breakfast was extensive.  The only negatives are that there was a smell of stale smoke in our room, and the music at dinner was so loud that it drowned out all conversation."
Superb hotel &amp; friendly staff. Facilities were awesome and so peaceful and tranquil as well. Breakfast buffet spread was amazing. Spa treatments were affordable. Rooms were a bit dated but large and spacious nevertheless. 
"Never doubt the quality in the name of Hyatt. I stayed here for a couple days, and very satisfied. The staffs were very helpful and nice, the room was very roomy, wifi was strong enough, breakfast was amazing. I love the welcome ‚Äúceremony‚Äù for every guest here with the flowers and welcome drink. "
"The Hyatt Regency is an excellent choice for families in Yogyakarta.  The property has a pool, water activities, golf, a kids club and more - and can keep kids entertained for hours between temple visits.   However, the property is dated and you don&#39;t want to look too close to the corners of your bathtubs.  The towels we were given at the pool were often stained and worn down.  The water slide has chipped paint etc.  The redeeming qualities of the hotel would be its staff which were incredibly pleasant and very accommodating and the plentitude of children acitvities on offer.  We would urge management to invest in new towels etc. to increase the appeal of the hotel."
"We visited Yogyakarta and decided to stay in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. We can never go wrong with Hyatt.  The property is old. But the people and the management never gets old. They are always ready to serve and help. We informed them that we were celebrating a special occasion (babyniversary) maybe its weird for some people but yes we do celebrate it, its the day we found out that I was pregnant with my 1st since we had difficulties trying so yeah there od such thing. There&#39;s a lot of activities in the hotel itself like hyattcamp, rent bike and spa but we did not get the chance to try hence we have tons of activities on our list.  The breakfast was superb. Theres egg station, my very own favorite juicing station, local food and pancakes. The only downfall was bacon, they dont</span><span>&hellip;"
"We visit this hotel year after year because of its warmth and sincerity.  It feels like our ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù.  Many of the staff have been there since before we started visiting eight years ago. I think that speaks volumes about the hotel management and the character of the hotel.  If you have an opportunity to visit Jogja I highly HIGHLY recommend this hotel.  If you have an opportunity to stay at the hotel, you will be blessed to meet Angonno, Dorra, and Ana in their impressive dining facilities. Angonno and Dorra have tremendously energetic and warm smiles.  Ana remembers details about us from years ago and they all provide beyond excellent service with professionalism and sincerity.  Fitry, especially, has gone above the call of duty countless times to provide superior</span><span>&hellip;"
"Our family of four (children aged 9 and 12) has spent the last 6 days at the Hyatt in Yogyakarta.  All of us have thoroughly enjoyed it.  The highlights have been: the gorgeous pool surrounds and super waterslide, the blissful spa treatments and massages, the scrumptious buffet breakfasts.   The outstanding staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and to share their culture and cuisine with warmth and friendliness.  The Hyatt makes a great base to explore the amazing temples of Borobudur and Prambanan as well as the Sultan&#39;s Water Castle (Taman Sari). Our family also thoroughly enjoyed a silver workshop at Studio 76 in the Silver district of Kota Gede.  We wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta and hope that one day we will be lucky enough to</span><span>&hellip;"
"If you enjoy a complex historical exploring, this is a place to visit.  There are so many aspects to this very charming city to discover.  Hindu, Buddhist, Dutch, British, Japanese all had their play with this cultural center of Java.  A beautiful University, unbelievable quality batik."
"what a great stay at Hyatt Regency, The Hotel was so clean, grande and have a great atmosphere around hotel.  beside extraordinary facilities such as: pool, golf, etc... the employees are very nice and humble... I consider my self to stay in the next trip to Yogyakarta.  thanks to my friend, azizah nurcahyani which giving me the advice to stay in this superbbb hotel..."
"Set in its own grounds a peaceful setting from the hustle and bustle of Jogja! Free Andong(horse and carriage) ride around the grounds, shuttle service into Malioboro Shopping area, and super attentive staff made this an ideal location for us. All in all an enjoyable holiday base for our visit to Borobudur.  Would recommend this hotel to for families and couples."
"Stayed for 2 night at regency club room and it was perfect. Privileged check in and free access to the club lounge.  All staff are great, they are so friendly to my kids. The outdoor activities makes my kids enjoy the day. They love the fishing area and andong (horse carriage) tour. The additional payment for kids breakfast/club is reasonable and some how for me it&#39;s cheaper compare to the other 5 star hotel in Yogyakarta.  One thing to be concerned is the coconut tree in the garden. One of the coconut fell close to me in the kids pool area. And I think the gardener need to give more attention about this. "
"We had a fantastic time yet again at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta.We always stay here when visiting Yogya it is just the best.the service as well as the setting is of the highest standard and we are never disappointed. It has one of the best nasi goreng i have ever had ,along  with a superb buffet breakfast that also takes some beating. The setting in the gatdens are just getting better every year as they mature. All in all absolute top class !!!"
"Stayed here after securing an insider deal via Agoda and lo and behold we were given the exclsuive private wing with its pantry  The rooms were a bit old fashioned but not in a bad way, nicely decorated and enough space for my three kids to run around. Booked two rooms and nicely enough were adjoined to added convinience, kudos to the front desk considerations.  The breakfast is too die for!   The swimming pools are even better with multiple levels and depth.   The free ride along the small villages from the hotel is the icing on top :)  Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will make an effort to come back!"
"This hotel is a bit old (furniture shows wear) but gorgeous grounds at a great price point. It&#39;s not the nicest hotel I&#39;ve been in - have stayed in far better for a few times the price - but hands down the best I&#39;ve experienced if I think about beauty/price ratio and definitely at least a &quot;very good&quot;, just not &quot;excellent&quot;. Pool looked great and there was a heated jacuzzi, just wish they sold swimwear on premise (many hotels I&#39;ve been to do so?). Food is great and still cheaper relative to the restaurant just outside the hotel main entrance. They have Sunday brunch till 3pm.  Bummer is that you have to pay IDR 300,000 for early check-in even if you&#39;re just an hour early and location isn&#39;t great (so we had to get a driver for entire duration). This was a trip with friends, but I</span><span>&hellip;"
"Very nice hotel with friendly staff. We had most of our meals here during the 2 day visit and really enjoyed the food. If you are there on a Saturday, don&#39;t miss the dinner with Ramayana Ballet. The spread is very good with lot of vegetarian options as well. you get to taste indonesian food. Ramayana ballet is also very good. The rooms are however quite small."
This is definitely the place to stay in Yogyakarta. The lush green landscape and gardens is what definitely got me to stay in this place. This place must be leaning towards foreigners. I&#39;m Asian who looks like Indonesian. Upon pickup at the airport the guy said he was expecting a westerner. Sorry to burst your expectations buddy. We had a grand welcome and had flower necklaces upon arrival with some arrival drinks. 1rst day was awesome. The hotel isn&#39;t new but it perfectly compliments Jogja as an old city. We woke up for breakfast and it was fantastic. The only funny part is the lady who checked us in the night before seemed to not recognize us the next day? She was like are you as a guest here? (ok you literally checked me in like 12 hours ago). Wehad a great time wandering the</span><span>&hellip;
"location is about 20-30 minutes drive to malioboro, but malioboro has nothing much to shout about!   The room is moldy and musty smells all the times and sign of aging.  But their customer service is really good!   This definitely compensated it."
"first time i got inside, i feel confuse why the reception desk located on the higher stairs than my room.  this unique settings really left in my mind until now.  and one thing surprise me, they serve manisan ( marinated young mango) in breakfast menu.   dont forget to try their traditional drink. (beras kencur, and kunir asem) really releaving"
Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is like having a small forest in the backyard and it also has a big swimming pool with a lagoon concept. The food is also tasty and various. They have a jogging track circling the hotel. The bedroom is quiet old.
"This is one of those places you need to visit. Rarely does a hotel live up to the brochure, the Hyatt Regency Jogya comes very close! Sure there is some minor maintenance needed here and there (mood and path lighting around grounds a bit neglected) though the feel of the place is so tranquil and relaxing. It&#39;s position is not city if that&#39;s what you like, it is pure secluded countrystyle. Peace and tranquility here. This is the place where you will find staff that truly know how to service their clients. They bother to actually know you, remember you by name quickly and spend time to talk and know you. Nothing is too difficult they are all genuine and beautiful people who care and know how to add personal touches. Rooms are comfortable and super clean, check out what aspect you</span><span>&hellip;"
"Staying here to celebrate our honeymoon, check in late night and meet Ms.Aulia the receptionist. She treats us very well from the first time we came until check out thumbs up for the reception team !! When entering to the room, so happy with room set up it was clean and tidy, Especially a bucket of red rose, my wife loves it. Big thanks to Housekeeping After a night with a good sleep, we woke up with happiness go around hotel area and very excited. Bfast was good, many variant to choose but just a little comment about the different treatment by restaurant staff. They must give an equal treatment for all guest. Because we see they give more attention to ‚ÄúBule‚Äù than local guest. Sorry to say that, but we can feel it. Such as no conversation even just asking what we looking for,</span><span>&hellip;"
"We were there in January 2018 and received very very good service. The experience was very pleasant.   First of all, the hotel itself is filled with many facilities and things to do. We manage to catch one of the horse ride around the hotel. There&#39;s a huge golf course, which we didn&#39;t use it at all because we can&#39;t play golf. But there are several pools available with different water level. It comes with a slide and a basketball hoop which is pretty family friendly.   We spent most of our nights at the lounge which serve different cuisine on different days and kept us very full every night. Special mention to one of the staff, Yayon, whom took extra care and share with us her experience during Merapi eruption which we were really interested to know.   In the morning, we really</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hospitality was THE BEST.  Hyatt is my Second Home in Yogyakarta.. The View was Breathtaking , i can feel the different atmosphere in here. Although the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is international hotels but still does not eliminate the cultural element. The last but not least, the have the delicious and fresh meal."
"Always feeling home ‚ù§Ô∏è. I know Hyatt from the soft opening and also grand opening untill now. Our family and friends always happy to stay at Hyatt Yogya. Nice garden, great food, perfect hotelüëçüëçüëç. Warm regards, Yani Weyen üòòüòòüòò"
"This is and will always be my favourite hotel in Yogyakarta. The minute you turn off from the Main Road, you are transported to an oasis of lush greenery and tradition.  Hotel is styled after the keraton palaces of old Yogyakarta, and the surroundings fuel of trees and landscaped greenery.  The pool is really awesome, multi- levelled and great breakfast view since the restaurant has an outside section that is poolside.  Staff are very friendly, courteous and helpful; for a frequently returning guest like me, Ibu Fitry and her team really goes all out to make me feel welcome.  Not forgetting all others at the Kemangi restaurant, this is really like my home in Jogja."
"Large and well-looked after grounds, with a large 3-tier swimming pool featuring a water slide. Hotel restaurant serves good food. It‚Äôs located slightly further away from main areas like Kraton or Malioboro street but the good thing is that the hotel provides almost hourly shuttles to Malioboro for some exploration."
"The hotel is located in a garden complex, with some interesting internal and external architectural features. The staff are excellent and went out of their way to fix things, which unfortunately happened on a couple of occasions (mixed up room service order, blocked toilet), and they followed up to check that everything was okay. I had a good sized room with a view towards Mt Merapi (apparently that wisp of smoke from the crater is nothing to worry about - the last eruption was in 2010). A few small things - bath towels are pretty much at the end of their useful life and could really do with updating; taps leaked onto the top of the vanity; shower over bath is usually fine but this one didn&#39;t feel entirely safe. So, almost excellent but the glitches (I was only there for two</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed with my partner from Feb 12 to Feb 16. It was superb, beyond our expectation. We felt like we stayed in a huge palace with a large garden, nice swimming pool, golf court, tennis court, etc. Breakfast is great with lots of choices, we had several dinner, both in Room Service or at the Restaurant. The foods are delicious with friendly and warm service from the staff. Having breakfast and dinner near the pool (outside of the restaurant) are our favorit spot. Our room were facing the garden, a very nice view and also a very nice room. Overall, this hotel really gives top notch service, ambience, facilities and everything. Hope to be back again when we‚Äôre in Yogyakarta. Thank you!"
"The hotel is close enough to the airport that you don&#39;t waste time getting back and forth. The hotel is lovely. The beds are comfortable with a wonderful bed/bedding and nice selection of english speaking tv channels. The wifi was spotty but sometimes you need to be removed a bit.  Breakfast was excellent with many choices, both eastern and western choices. The staff in the entire hotel all have wonderful attitudes that make you happy to be spending your days at the HYATT. The attitudes starts from the top! The spa is a treat, of course. The golf course looks inviting but I dont think they have golf carts (maybe just caddies?). I&#39;ll golf next time. It does seem to be a family hotel, so do be prepared for some ill behaved kids running amuck. The hotel is big enough to find peace</span><span>&hellip;"
The only hotel in Yogjakarta with the largest garden. Magnificent landscaping with fantastic variety of plants  The greenery is so uplifting after a tiring tour and a sight for sore eyes.  Cooling and great jogging track  The pools lovely too.  Rooms a little old fashioned but that&#39;s ok with me. The room size is adequate with all the things you need. My room has view of 2 volcanoes! Fresh fruits daily! Breakfast spread is huge and lots of selection.  I&#39;m glad it&#39;s far from town (only 20 mins drive away ) and the din of traffic as you rejuvenate in this oasis of calm and greenery  
"The hotel serving local food that is awesome, the indigenous of the local culture can discover start here with very strong connection from the hotel design, the food the art, the attire, the language. The cleanliness, the ambiance really make me and friend felt relax and calm away from busy city and working routine felt really release with cozy in the morning after breakfast, the city have a lot thing to do and try,the concierge, front desk is superb with information even the chef also suggest us where to dine in the area to find local food, they serve me and friend with very great suggestion about the place to visit, to dine, they arrange us transportation and felt surprise when we arrive they really welcoming us, the service &amp; product is from them is the best and the reason</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed for 3 nights here and been enjoying my stay.  Pluses:  - Comfortable room although it&#39;s considered an old hotel - All lights everywhere, making me feeling comfortable - Love the laundry service, always on time and the laundry result is great!  - I like the lobby, the flowery scent is great  - Great bed that made me fell asleep so fast   Minuses:  - I stayed for 3 nights, I had breakfast with the same menu again and again for the consecutive days. Why? Not because I always eat the same stuff, but the main menu remain the same. It would be better to have more options for the breakfast   Too bad I couldn&#39;t swim there due to my schedule. Would love to try the nice pool.  Overall, I enjoy my stay here :)"
Beautiful hotel with lush landscaping.  Rooms are spacious with nice bath &amp; shower area.   Golf course is exquisite.  Caddies all very professional.  Hotel staff all very friendly and professional.  Concierge was very polite. Breakfast buffet had many choices.
"The Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is a calm oasis. The public areas of the hotel are gorgeous with lovely views across the gardens and koi ponds (just ask for some fish food if you want to feed them). The staff were helpful and friendly, even at 3am when we checked out prior to a Borobudur sunrise tour. The restaurant food is great, with loads of options. The rooms are a bit dated, but impeccably clean, roomy and comfortable."
"I went on the 26th and quickly fell in love with Hyatt when the moment I stepped down from my transport I was greeted very warmly by the staffs and immediately feel safe. The security was very tight. They checked your vehicle before you can enter the hotel compund and guests have to go through metal scanner first before proceed to the reception counter. Though i&#39;m not a big fan of the waiting time - they only let you have your key at exactly 2pm and did nothing to expedite the process. Exhausted and sleepy, I was forced to go to the salon to wash my hair to kill some time... but luckily, attended by a friendly hairdresser. Overall room cleanliness a bit dissapointing as I found some pink gunk stuck on the floor. Room need some upgrade but I was quite happy with the food served.</span><span>&hellip;"
"My first impression upon arriving at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is that it&#39;s a spacious and beautiful property. Despite being obviously old, the buildings and rooms are in terrific conditions, completed with modern toiletries.   We were there for business meetings and stayed for 2 nights, during which I was thoroughly impressed by professionalism of the staffs. There were 30 persons in our group, but there were other groups of about 200 persons, but never once did we had any difficulties in arranging our meetings and other activities. The staffs are very responsive to our requests, it&#39;s incredibly convenient.   I love the view from my room. I stayed at room 108 with the golf range view. But next time, I will ask for mountain view room, room with balconies. I also love the</span><span>&hellip;"
The service provided was very good. The scenary was pleasing and clean. The room was clean and well organized. The breakfast was very good. The facilities provided is well preserved and complete. Looking forward to come here again
"location was good for relax..staff are good. enjoyed the atmosphere..and good for refresh your self from activity.  but i have hyatt passport gold can not use..so make new member world of hyatt. it was a pity that the point was gone...  hope all membership, point should be not expired or mmembersip not expired.  regards papa bear"
"Being Hyatt loyalty members, we usually stay in Hyatt properties wherever we travel. The property at Yogyakarta seems to be one that Hyatt has either just taken over or is completely ignoring. Beautiful golf course but run down rooms. But the most disappointing part is the food. The there is only one running restaurant as the bar has some work going on. I&#39;ve tried most of the things on the menu and was severely disappointed. A basic Indonesian dish like Nasi Goreng also was terrible. The Asian section listed Roti Canai which I got excited about so I inquired about it. The chef came out with a packet of frozen roti canais to show me what would be served. Frozen food, reheated and served in a five-star hotel?? You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. And that too was raw and under-cooked when</span><span>&hellip;"
"It wasn&#39;t my first time in this Hotel but I do really like it. The grounds and the pool area are very beautiful, to sit outside in the evening and enjoy the fresh air is just awesome.  The pool is very nice and big and was very clean when we have been there. There are even two water slides, which have been enjoyed by us adults as much as some kids who stayed in the hotel too.  The food is good, breakfast offers enough choice as well.  Overall it might not be the newest hotel, but it is definitely worth a visit."
"When we heard the brand name it is common to have high expectation from this hotel. However the fact is :  Location : the hotel is in secluded place and it is quite far from Jogjakarta attractions centre.  The building: is quite old and need some refurbishment here and there.  The check in and out : no issue here.  The room : quite spacious but the bed need to be replace. Complete itenary. Bathroom is also spacious, bathtub and shower in the bathtub which I didn&#39;t like. It is clean.  Breakfast : spacious restaurant, have indoor and outdoor area. Lots of food and drink varieties. The taste is fine nothing extraordinary.  Pool: is huge but again it is not well maintained.  Price: is high compared to the services.  Internet access: too slow for a well known brand hotel  Overall: it</span><span>&hellip;"
"No fret if you don&#39;t feel like going out to explore.  Just enjoy the hotel, no regrets staying in !!  Jogja has lots of nature adventure in store for people from all walks of life.  Cave tubing or volcano hiking or beach outing or forest visit.  Me and my family manage to cover a few activities only and do not mind going back to try out other activities....."
"We are a family of four from Australia including two young daughters,staying at this hotel for three days.  We have travelled the world, and we put this hotel‚Äôs service up there with the best in the world.  Each staff member gives perfect customer service from arrival to departure. We had dinner each day and it was delicious each time, thank you to the chefs. The buffet breakfast is also ten out of ten, with huge selections to choose from. Our daughters loved the huge pool with slide.  The tour desk is also wonderful, with booking flights for us. We thoroughly recommend them in organising your tours or flights.  Thank you everyone, we will miss your beautiful smiles.  "
"Surprised how this property is well maintained. The garden was absolutely worth the stroll . It was raining at nite during my stay, and that make it more perfect. Peace and calm . Perfect stay . The outdoor area during breakfast was perfect , plenty of food choices . Dont forget the Lava Egg !"
"Currently staying in a very dated deluxe room on the first floor. Where do I begin. Reviews that were saying no hot water and isolation are true, I have proven that myself. Have not tried the breakfast but will go soon.   I am planning to bring a group of 50 international lawyers here in October but I am having a second thought because the rooms are very dated and I want my guests to not only enjoy the hotel grounds but also to be able to relax in a nicely modern rooms. Having a golf course on the spot is great but to me, having a good night sleep without distraction of unnecessary noise is utmost important.   Also, having to have a working hot water and internet are the other important things. I have traveled around the world and stayed at many of Hyatt properties and this one</span><span>&hellip;"
"The Hyatt Yogyakarta is a beautiful resort. The garden and swimming pool is phenomenal (includes swimming pool bar and water slide from an ancient temple as well!), the restaurant serves excellent food (breakfast buffet is very nice) and there is a great SPA on-site. Beyond that, the hotel looks gorgeous and gives a very peaceful feeling. Areas of attention: the rooms feel quite dated (especially the bathrooms) and isolation could be better and the breakfast box (when going on early trips) is a bit limited. Prices are a bit steep compared to other hotels in the area, but overall a really nice place to stay!"
"Very friendly staff, nice swimming pool with slide which is a plus for my family, nice bed and lots of breakfasts choices. Definitely will be back here on our next visit to Jogjakarta... Super happy! :)"
"Our family had a wonderful stay at Hyatt Regency Hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted with very warm smiles and hospitable staff. We were welcomed with flower garland and drinks and our luggages sent to our room. Check-in process was very smooth and quick. We were assisted by a very kind and friendly staff named Meirisa. On our first night, we had our dinner at the restaurant. They offer great choices of food and drinks. Great service from Purwanto, Ana and Ivan. They are all very attentive, friendly and even tries to strike a conversation asking how our day was etc. Great service also from Irna for helping us book a cab back to the airport and Ircha for a very fast check-out process.  Rooms are clean, bed was comfortable, wi-fi works very well, the hallway and lobby smells</span><span>&hellip;"
"Although it is located a bit far from malioboro but it s worth to stay at hyatt. The check in process is very fast, room is nice and food is delicious. You also can do jogging around the hotel property. "
"Beautiful hotel in style of the surrounding temples. Fantastic service and always with a smile. Great food and club room well worth the little extra spend. Super choice of pools and facilities, maybe only lacking an additional choice of restaurant. Will definitely come back here."
"The hotel area is an extensive property with lots of facilities (swimming, spa, health club, golf, for kids: horse rides, free bikes, even camps for half or full day, if you want to have some time with your spouse) which makes sure you can have a great time at the hotel! The staff is very caring and helpful. We were taken extra care of with our vegetarian meals (sometimes created / recommended specially by the chef) when we had food at the hotel. Overall it is a stunning property (artworks, meals by the pool, the stone structures, tree house which my son loved) and you can make use of the little nooks throughout the property (choose a room with balcony if possible, we did our yoga, painting sessions there) they have created for a perfect family getaway. Yogyakarta is culturally</span><span>&hellip;"
"The rooms are old and sheets/towels have stains on them. Not really up to the standards of other Hyatt. Aside from it‚Äôs large property and extensive pool, perhaps it‚Äôs worth considering staying elsewhere. "
"Good place to ease your mind. if you an art lover , you could spend hours observing the sculpture. They have an art exhibition during my stay. I spend hours look at all the painting. Love every piece of it. Room is spacious. Choose room with balcony. you can spend hours at the balcony as it has nice scenery. I love everything about the hotel."
"The hotel is very good with the service and guest room. Check-in services is very fast eventhough there was some problem for F&amp;B package that listed on my email and hotel notes, but they solved it quickly. There are many pools at hotel that make guest more comfortable to choose. "
"We went for the new year&#39;s eve countdown party at the hotel. It was a great one for its food, entertainment and actives (wishing lanterns).  We stayed on the next day for 2-nights, and despite in high season we still had great time in the pool. This hotel is recommended if you like a resort type stay to soak in the pool and enjoy the garden."
"Honestly, I think if Hyatt chain audited this hotel they would have lost a star or the license to carry the name. I have quite a lot to write and I gave 2/5 because if I knew how this will be I would probably not go there to begin with, choose a different hotel. Main reason: the room has zero isolation, every 5am we woke up from the minerate, in the corridor non stop noise, and when our neighbours on top or side watched TV we had to listen to it too. Isolation of noise was also a problem when we had a massage, we had to listen to a live concert that was nearby. Not very soothing and calming as we wanted.  On our first day the shower didn&#39;t have hot water, it was warm-ish but not nice to shower. Breakfast is very very good, excellent quality and much to choose from, however if</span><span>&hellip;"
"First impression upon arrival was very impressive, full of big trees, garden and lawn.  Lobby decoration looks good too, but too crowded.  Rooms decoration is very conventional and a bit run down.  Air-condition in the room is not so good, temperature is ok but my hygrometer showed 82% humidity when I woke up."
"Hotel looks amazing but details show carelessness such as dirty rugs in the lobby, no towels available in the pool during morning, old and tiny bath tubs. Some staff are really friendly and nice but some are rude, no consistency in the service you recieve."
"First day when we arrived, we had pleasant check in.  My wife and myself enjoyed the happy hours of the club lounge.  There are few Indonesian vegetarian options, which they don&#39;t specify it but if you are curious, they prepare it well. Chef Riva gave us Indian Rasam (curry) with white rice and potato dish sandwich."
A favourite place for a getaway!! Great food. Ambience with scenery of Mt. Merapi Plenty of swimming poolsstaff is warm and friendly.  Restaurant does great job on the food and terrific breakfast buffet-huge selection. 
The hotel environment is great. The breakfast buffet selection is not too bad but the cleanliness of the restaurant needs to be improved. The hotel and restaurant staff needs to be more pro-active to fulfill the hotel guests‚Äô needs.
"Just finished a 3-night stay here and could not be happier with the service and club lounge experience. ¬†The hotel is a bit out of the center of town, which may or may not be issue depending on why you&#39;re in Jogja. ¬†Grab/Uber is cheap and plentiful, although traffic is a bear. ¬†The grounds are parklike, which is expected since the hotel is really a golf resort. ¬†There is a nice 2k jogging track on the grounds. ¬†The pool complex (!) is neat for kids - there are several pools that wind their way around. ¬†The standalone fitness room is tiny and requires a walk past the pool. ¬†Room furnishings are dated, but everything was in good condition and the space adequate.  Where this place really shines is the service, food and club lounge experience. ¬†Service really is top-notch. ¬†Nearly</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency in the Presidential suite for 3 nights in the last week of December.  The hotel arranged an airport transfer for 120,000 INR with the driver waiting for us upon existing baggage claims.  Check in was a breeze.    Our suite was on the top floor with views of Mt Merapati, the pool and golf courses.  The room had two full bathrooms, living room, kitchen. And a massive wrap around balcony with patio table and sun lounge chairs.  There was a dvd/cd player with nose surround sound although the dvd was not connected directly to the tv.  We had a hdmi cable that solved that.  The suite included access to the lounge which has ample drinks (alcoholic and non) as well as hors d‚Äôoeuvres that essentially was like dinner.  The your desk in the lobby arranged</span><span>&hellip;"
"A little tough to review our experience at this place because it was such a mixed bag.  Check in was horrendous and took nearly two hours due to inefficiency and confusion about our reservation in spite of having contacted the hotel in advance.  The first room we were assigned, a standard room, was disgraceful. There were no towels, one robe only, no slippers, and non-functioning Internet.  And the bathroom was straight out of the 1970s, depressing and extremely dated like one you would see in an old person&#39;s home in the US who hadn&#39;t done any updates since they bought the house, with a shower/tub combo and ancient tile work.  We raised a stink and eventually were moved to the Club Room we had booked.  That room was better- still old but with a nice marble bathroom and separate</span><span>&hellip;"
Hyatt regency Yogyakarta is a sprawling property with even a golf course inside. The rooms are very spacious and the property has many activities for all ages. The spa is very good with complimentary Jacuzzi and Sauna.  One can also take complimentary bicycles. Interestingly the 24 hour menu at the hotel has a very good Vegetarian choice. Try roti canai  and green fried rice.
I booked a room there for our trip to Yogyakarta there with my wife. The staff there is helpful and friendly. The food taste fantistic and the room itself is clean and tidy when we first got there and they keep it that way til the end of our stay.
"Stayed in the hotel during one conference, and mesmerized by the tranquility by its garden came back few months later with whole family. The top aspect of this resort-hotel was its tropical garden with multiple pools. Lovely place to relax after sightseeing nearby attractions. Conveniently located half way between airport and the Yogja downtown - which is great if you need faster access to the airport. However one need to note that is relatively far from Yogja itself (1 our walking or 20 min ( without traffic by free shuttle bus -which stops at 9 pm). The hotel itself is great but aged (room need some renovation). Good customer service although not very personal. Restaurant adequate for the standard. The weekend gala dinner with life music and open buffet is highly recommended.</span><span>&hellip;"
"We recently stayed here for 5 nights and we had an amazing time. The service is fantastic, everyone smiles and acknowledges you, the staff is friendly and made my two little boys feel very special and welcome. We enjoyed the pool and slide. They have a smaller and shallower pool for the younger kids but we didn&#39;t end up using it. The grounds and entrance were stunning. We enjoyed the regency club benefits and we truly recommend it. The room and bed were very comfortable and clean. I thought it was a lovely touch how cute the portacot for our youngest was set up. I would most definitely stay here again if returning to Jogyakarta."
"This hotel is very recommended for vacation and business purposes. with great room, lots of fine and decorative arts, has a large swimming pool, has a beautiful park and a golf park. Staff hotel very helpful, check in is fast. Good service.  Recommended to stay when you are in Yogyakarta."
"Me and my wife went to Yogjakarta for our honeymoon and we chose Hyatt Regency as our place to stay. The moment we arrived at the hotel, we felt very welcomed by the hotel staff. They The room was perfect and the hotel was very beautiful."
"I have stayed in many 5 stars hotels, but i&#39;ve never experience extra level of hospitality. Im in love with the team, they ere very attentive. Also they have the best spa in town. The food are great, th"
Spent a week at this rather aged but still in very good condition resort in Yogyakarta and loved every bit of my stay. The room is basic but the grounds of the hotel are what blew me away. The hotel has a golf course attached to it and a jogging trail. The gym room is rather small but effective with the necessary machines. The food in the dinning is heavenly and the staff are so polite and helpful. The hotel has a club house which has live music and karaoke on some days. Danced to the lovely music with my friends one of the nights and loved the ambiance. Met the hotel GM and he is a gracious person. Attending the Christmas tree lighting ceremony at the hotel during my stay and it was exciting with lots of eats and drinks and lovely choirs. This will be my hotel of choice when I</span><span>&hellip;
"during my stay, a lot of art stuff like paintings, sculpture and monument which were put all over the places inside the hotel and keep changing every day. It really made everyday look it was different and I really enjoy it."
"Very impressive check-in process; Some facilities in a room were quite old - shower and beds, etc. However, very nice environment around hotel - you can take a walk around golf course and enjoy outside swimming pool."
A couple of  service staff  was quite outstanding. Overall the ambience was great suitable for holidays or retreats. The beautiful Pool has also an added attractive feature for anyone to unwind or to laze around
"This is a very goof hotel. However, the staff make this an excellent hotel. We will be returning here regularly in the future just to visit our new friends. We were looked after like family and there was nothing that we could have wanted more. Even our anniversary was celebrated with our staff friends.  It would be impossible to improve on this hotel but without the staff it is just a building. A very good building were everything works, but a building just the same."
Excellent hotel with a wonderful pool and splendid natural environment. Sumptuous breakfast and nice service..room service was excellent. Try the homemade squash which is one of a kind.... Will definitely come back..
Stayed here for our honeymoon on 28 March 2017. Welcome drink and flowers were the first service upon our arrival at Hyatt Regency. Staffs are very warm and helpful. Room are very comfort with classic design and decorated with flowers on the bed and in the bathub as we request for honeymoon. Breakfast is very delicious and wide of selection. The view of Merapi mountain is the wow factor. Imagine that you&#39;ve enjoy omelette and sip earl grey tea looking the Merapi view.  What a breathtaking view.  Definetely one of the best 5 stars hotel in Yogyakarta. 
"Good service and good food, we especially liked it. This probably best price - quality we can find in Yogyakarta. The service is very good and all waiter smiling and want to help. We easy can change the room for good view."
"The room need general cleaning as specialy at around the heard bord litte bit dirty , and same small black animal ,  I like the breakfast , the food combine , the services and etc  Good garden is very nice to jogging  "
"The staff at this Hyatt was the BEST staff I have ever had. They were extremely welcoming, helpful, and enjoyable - they welcomed us with refreshments, a picture (later framed and given to us). As it was my anniversary, our room was filled with roses throughout, towel swans, decor and a note from the staff. This staff went above and beyond. I can&#39;t tell you enough how great everyone was to us. Amenities are great. Food (breakfast) was delicious. Highly recommend this hotel!"
Had a very pleasurable stay at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. Very impressed with the rooms (used a suite upgrade) and the service I received. E.g. we were able to get the help to pack an early breakfast for our trip to Borobudur at 3:30am and to get a cab for us in the early hours of the morning. Will be back in the future!
"Wonderful sprawling resort in Yogyakarta offers much more than just a good night sleep.  One of the best hotel in the region offers endless lush gardens, relaxing free-shaped pools, excellent food and spacious rooms. Ok, the rooms could get a bit of modernizing but you get the authentic feel of Indonesia through the architecture and overall style.  I would recommend choosing the Club Room which comes with complimentary afternoon food and drinks and functions as private check-in desk and concierge.  Hotel is an only 30min drive from the airport and 10min from the city center and major malls. I enjoyed the location and could disconnect from the outside world and relax.  Perfect for chilling or exploring amazing Yogyakarta region.   For detailed review and tons of photos visit my</span><span>&hellip;"
its such a wonderful. breakfast was excellent with so many variety of food combining traditional and international food &amp; beverages. the hotel is very clean and very well maintained.  highly recommended hotelüôåüèª
"We stayed at the Hyatt for 3 nights before departing for Bali. From check-in to departure the service was excellent. Every staff member was helpful and attentive and if they were unable to help, they would ask someone else to assists. The travel desk is excellent, quick, efficient and honest about the options available and what is worth doing. They do not try to sell you on the most expensive thing,  nor push you for anything you may not want. The daily breakfast is great and offers plenty of variety of everyone‚Äôs palate. The alcohol selection could be better, but you have to keep in mind which part of the world you are in. The property is beautiful and well maintained as well as the pool and the 24/7 gym facilities. Location is great, about 20 minutes from the center of town</span><span>&hellip;"
"After a 3-day stay; Amazing service - which i believe they had won an award for, great food options. Really considerate and accommodating hotel travel desk that can completely take care of local site seeing options. The property is huge and well taken care of - they were doing minor remodeling when I was there and I didn‚Äôt even notice. "
"The building was inspired by Borobudur Temple, so all the rooms&#39; view are facing the greenery of the park or golf. Secluded and yet not so far from the city centre. A recommended hotel either for business, couple leisure  or even family leisure."
"If you can please put more direction sign for LIFT.  Room cosy, garden and pool area beautiful. Many areas to take pictures. Breakfast area very nice near the pool. Good distance to many Candi and Jejamuran by car. "
Hi we stayed at the Hyatt in Yogya and as an American IÔ∏è would not say it‚Äôs really a Hyatt standard but nice and comfortable and really affordable option to visit the many temples and attraction around. The room was normal nice view overlooking park with a huge walk-in closet. Bathroom ok except hot water takes a good 5 min to come out. Restaurant is nice with a huge selection for breakfast but feels a bit too busy as probably between 50-100 guest are eating at the same time. The waiters and staff are extremely sweet and helpful. The poolside is nice with slides and activities for kids. Overall nice hotel and would recommend it as a good option
"Stayed here to celebrate our 3 years anniversary. We had very fast check-in process, staff were so welcoming and friendly. We have a very nice room with special set up treatment. Thank you for all staff in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, especially many thanks for Bapak Ateng Aditya, Director Of Rooms, who helped to arrange and prepare everything so that our stay was so memorable. "
"stayed at Regency Club Room for two night. check in process was quick and easy. The Room was spacious and neat. I informed the hotel that it was my honeymoon trip, and the hotel give roses petal at the bed and the bathtub. Nice treat. My wife really like it. The breakfast was great. a lot of options from the buffet. choose to eat at the pool side. the view is great. since i stayed at regency club, every evening the hotel provided Evening Cocktail with varieties of small bites, free flow wine and other alcohol drink. overall it was such a nice honeymoon. "
"Positives Staff accommodating and very pleasant to deal with. Food great with a mix of western and local cuisine, many types of sambal and chefs happy to talk to you which was great. Events at the hotel like a Night Market and Ramayana Ballet well put together. The spa affordable, good Shiatsu massage and therapists accommodating when we needed to move appointments made. Beautiful pool with surprising water slide, grounds of the hotel were magical with great landscaping and truly breathtaking. Extra in room options available such as pillow menu, request for an iron, razors etc. Location great for visits to Borobudur, Prambanan and other major temples.  Constructive feedback It would of been handy to have been told that a packed lunch would be available for collection on site</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel is very tranquil and calming. It&#39;s a great place for doing nothing for pleasure. My kid love the fast swimming pool and the water slide, unfortunately the small one was broken. but we still enjoy the experience nevertheless."
"Excellent hotel with lots of cared &amp; friendly staff. So many facilities you can do &amp; there‚Äôs beautiful scenery around you. The breakfast buffet is great enough. And the one that I personally like is the hot water is always ON &amp; the water pressure is very strong, so my bath time is very great. You truly can‚Äôt go wrong stay in this hotel, this hotel gives me a pleasing experience &amp; they will give it to you too. :)"
We were there for 5 days and the attention is very warm and the attention is excellent. The hotel offers many activities for the family and it has beautiful landscapes. Do not think it twice to stay in this hotel :-)
"Always want to come back to this hotel everytime i visit Yogyakarta. The staff is very kind, helpful, and sincerely give their best effort to accommodate our request. The restaurant, garden, jogging track and hotel surrounding view is beautiful. The food is delicious and the room is nice as well as the bathroom. But i wish the room floor is covered with larger carpet, since it&#39;s quite cold in the morning to walk barefoot inside the room. Better and thoroughly maintenance would be required since this is quite old building"
Hyatt is one of the best hotel that myself and my family visited. compare with the other 5 star hotel around in Indonesia.  this is my second visited there. and we still love everything there. even my kids love to stay there.
My family and I was there for two nights. Good and present experience overall from checking in to departure. Even though we didn‚Äôt spend must time in the premise because were always our sight seeing but whenever we were back there were always nice service and welcoming atmosphere.
"Nice hotel, cleaned room, tasty food and beverage, scattered and full of choices breakfast menu, big pool with sliding, very friendly staf. Very recommended for family trip. Spacious room. My kid very love the nasi goreng! ‚ù§"
Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is the best place to stay with your family and I will come back to stay at Hyatt Yogyakarta. The place is very big and really like the feeling of the green and koi fish. I hope they can start to renew their president suite because it was too old.
"I just wanna say thank you with hyatt. Services, facility, all is perfect. When i visited jogja and stay in this hotel completely wonderful.  I felt i chose all in the right way.  I will be back with family and feel again the atmosphere jogjakarta from this hotel.  Perfect!"
"The staff are very nice &amp; helpfull, the hotel room is not very modern but overall was nice. Suggested the hotel to separate floors with smoking &amp; non-smoking area, not really healthy for the baby along the hallway with all smoking free signs. Check-in/out ruless really strict, need to be more flexible for guests with baby"
"4 days spent on this amazing hotel, we are very excited. The people is cheerful and kind. We love the food both Indonesian and Western. Sport facility i.e swimming pool, gym are clean and suitable for us. The one that we&#39;ve never forgot was me and my wife both love Nasi Merah (Brown Rice), and you know this hotel is served this kind of rare thing for us. Thanks you Hyatt I&#39;ll be back."
I stayed at this hotel for around 4-5 days.   Quite surprised how comfortable my kids got here. I think the slide at pool did a good job.  Food is nice and staff definitely is pleasant and helpful.  Place is quite. View is nice. Balcony is an added advantage. Ask for view to the volcano. It really looks splendid.  Left my phone in a taxi and the staff was quick to call the company and sort the issue. Go it back in less than 15 mins.  Recommend this .. always.
"This is my second time to this hotel and again had a great stay with fantastic helpful staff.  As I said in my previous review the downside is that the hotel is a little tired, but I am assured that there is possibility of an upgrade in the future.  Big shout and thank you to Nur  the hotel manager for a wonderful stay."
We are staying here for 5 nights and today is our first day. The staff is very friendly and the hotel is very very nice but today hotel guests cannot sit outside because of an event. People from outside book the whole terrace. This is frustrating. I&#39;m here for vacations and not to sit inside like st home. 
"My husband and I went to Yogyakarta for a short weekend gateaway to celebrate 5-year-wedding anniversary. We chose Hyatt because we got married at Grand Hyatt in Singapore. The stay turned out to be perfect. The staff decorated our club king room with happy anniversary flags in the window and a bouquet of roses! It was very thoughtful of them. All the staffs were truly wonderful, warm and offered so much useful information on Yogyakarta!"
"Was here for a wedding and we spent most of our time in the hotel. From massages at the spa, drinks by the pool to delicious local food at the hotel restaurant, we had a great time all round. Good for families "
"Come to this hotel feels like my 2nd home, very awesome ambiance and view.  Balcony room especially, view of mount merapi , garden and golf field. Breakfast always the best, all attendants at Kemangi and Chef Sugeng, know what my favourite, starting with lemon and honey, bacon, lava egg, gudeg, assorted traditional food, fresh juice, fresh fruits and double espresso. Front desk staff very kind, Fitri. Only need refurbish at room, but still ok because of the view and best service... "
"We thoroughly enjoyed a week&#39;s stay with 2 connecting Club rooms (for my family of 4 incl. 6 y.o. son &amp; 18m daughter + maid). Clean, comfortable and rustic with views over the pool &amp; lush vegetation.   Booking connecting Club rooms was very convenient and enabled us to enjoy inclusive breakfast and cocktails (excellent dishes for kids too!). First time I&#39;ve had a chicken caesar salad made to order which was superb. Each night local delicacies freshly prepared were beautifully presented.  Delightful grounds, kids club, welcome BBQ and other events throughout the week made this a very relaxing stay. And of course the pool and its extensive slide was a big hit for my son who learnt to finish (thanks Henry of the Kids Club!).  Lastly complementary minibus to Malioboro shopping</span><span>&hellip;"
"This was our first time in a Hyatt and we definitely want to come back! It is an absolutely beautiful and big hotel. I love the restaurant, and swimming pool. even it has slide! definetely recommended for family trip. athere is free jacuzzi pool as well."
"I stayed there with my mom right after ied mubarak this year. As the city become way over crowed with tourist, we decide to spend more time in hotel. This hotel is just perfect for any occasion. As for my mom, its lovely to walking around following path along the golf next to hotel. And myself just couldn&#39;t help to not falling in love with their pool! Breakfast was huge and great, i love every food there, and also their cappuchino. Oh i couldn&#39;t wait to back and enjoy this beutifull resort again."
"This was our first time in a Hyatt and we definitely want to come back! It is an absolutely beautiful and big hotel, located a bit far away from busy Yogyakarta downtown but they do offer a free shuttle to Malioboro departing every hour or so. We didn&#39;t feel the need to go outside of the hotel as we used these few days to relax and you basically have all you need inside the resort. There is a variety of good food for modest prices, the pools are stunning and we had so much fun at the waterslide. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms have an average size and look like they haven&#39;t been refreshed for quite a while, however, ours was always very clean and put together. I couldn&#39;t recommend this more!"
"The staff are nice, the room is spacious, they provide you the variety of Indonesian, Chinese and western Breakfast &amp; the pool was amazingly big! Everything went ok,  Except I was disturbed in the early morning by a loud speaker / event held outside (before 6 a.m). Kinda hoping for a peaceful morning."
"The hotel is nicely situated in a calm and green area with great views. When we arrived a company had rented the premises for some celebration which meant a lot of loud music till late night and crowded restaurants. The rooms were quite small compared to others we stayed in at the same price and looked like they hadn&#39;t been renovated for quite some time, still they were clean and kept in good order. Breakfast was good, the kids really liked the huge pool with waterslide. Its a good destination when you want to visit Borobudur and Prambanan."
Good cleaning of part their room hotel. Good interactive guess between. Enough far away from crowded and traffic of Yogyakarta‚Äôs downtown. Good food and beverage with many selection. Good price than other hotel at a same location. 
"Everything good but I suggestion to hotel for check condition of chair and sofa in room every day or week (Reference - Cushion is abnormal condition)  Also, Please check ventilation system in smoking floor."
"The hotel and especially the grounds are beautiful. They have 3 pools, and a lot of small seating areas so it feels very private. We had breakfast every morning which is great, so much choice in asian and european food, fresh fruit, an egg and waffle station and even the possibility to have your own smoothie made. The rooms were nice, perfect size and the bed was good. Bathroom could do with some updating. We used the free shuttle to the city center every day. It rins every other hour from 9-9 but has to be reserved in advance and only seats 10 (was never an issue)."
"My friend and I had an amazing stay - staff were very welcoming and kind despite our often odd requests, catering was delicious and the cooking class was great, and we enjoyed our cycle tour (but would recommend wearing helmets, the road is pretty bumpy). Thanks so much for a great stay!"
"I didn&#39;t actually stay at the Hyatt as all rooms were booked however they did but me in touch with their tour desk Angsa Tours and even though I was staying elsewhere they Organised my Borobudur Tour. The day was excellent, our tour guide Yun was excellent and so informative. The only disappointment was they seemed to take the Long way back through the villages which meant we went over time and was charged and extra hour, very disappointing as it was not our choice to go that way.  Based on the great information Yun gave us we decided to do the Prambanan Temple the following day. They were able to accommodate us the following day and we paid in advance. I cannot believe they charged us the same price for Borobudur and Prambanan, which is much closer. Our guide, I do not know his</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for 3 nights. I have a mixed review here, though overall any complaints will probably just be nitpicking.   To start, the property is spectacular and stunning. Every detail is amazing. The golf course is beautiful, the pool is beautiful and the facilities are beautiful. No complaints on the outside.   Let‚Äôs go to the room. Mine was of adequate size. I didn‚Äôt have much of a view, but I also had their standard room. The shower, to me, was a bit small. I am about 6‚Äô1‚Äù, 230 lbs, and I felt really cramped in the shower. That would be my only complaint.   The staff. Excellent. Attentive. Friendly. Zero complaints.   Fitness center. Well‚Ä¶. Really no such thing. They have a ‚Äúgym‚Äù that is actually the size of my room itself. There is a couple of</span><span>&hellip;"
"We booked a room with a king bed that was actually a queen size bed.  We called the front desk and they said it was a king bed. A few doors down was a suite with an actual king bed in it and housekeeping admitted to me that there was definitely a difference in size between the two. I&#39;m really having trouble figuring out why this is considreded ok, because I feel like I was lied to.  Also, if you book a massage in the spa, be sure to book during the day. I booked mine at about 5:30 or 6PM and 10 mins after it started there was loud electronic music litteraky BLASTING from a cafe next door to the hotel which made it impossible to fully relax."
My experience staying at the outdoor part of the restaurant for breakfast and and dinner were great and unforgettable. The trees covering the restaurant makes the outdoor part of the restaurant look and feel natural and cool. The newly added  glass roof ensures that guests will not get wet when it&#39;s raining and thus do not need to leave the premise.
"Very attractive hotel and environment. Lovely gardens and spacious, well-equipped comfortable rooms, consistent with the better Hyatt Regency hotels elsewhere. Great buffet breakfasts with excellent local and international cuisine. Great service. Very pleasant clubroom but limited dining. Great multiple cascading swimming pools."
"Having originally from Yogya, I always stays in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta every time I came with my partner to visit my family in Yogyakarta. This time we came with my in laws as well. Hyatt gone extra miles to make sure our stays amazing. My in laws were so happy with the service and so was I. I always felt home in this place. The swimming pools and the gardens are exquisite and well groomed. The breakfast buffet was the best I&#39;ve ever had! "
"Perfect hotel for your staycation, the beautiful view makes us very comfortable and relax. I am in love with the ambiance and pool. I think your room is time to be renovated to be more awesome. Good luck Hyatt"
"In the world of Hyatt, Hyatt regency Yogyakarta is unique. The pyramid architecture of the hotel building has no second one. The location is at the suburb of the city. Taxi can be easily hired anytime at its parking lots, if customers want to visit Malioboro boulevard. The green plantation is well cultivated along the multi-levels pools, golf courts, and main building. In a walking distance, some convenient stores can be found along the streets, not very isolated. It is an old hotels with good maintenance for years. Some facilities have worn out but acceptable with own styles. The elevators seem to be an antique but still work. The room rates are correctly aiming for luxury markets and competitive in town. It is therefore popular with meetings and events, couples, family, golf</span><span>&hellip;"
"Food, service and accommodation was excellent. Very friendly staff and prompt in their service. Has great facilities indoors where kids can really enjoy the pool and treehouse, a track to run, to walk, a restaurant and a club with reasonable prices, a spacious terrace outside the hotel lobby, a large beautiful, neat and tidy landscaped garden with cultural artefacts and a convenience store in the hotel so very proximate. Easy access to Malls too by cab which can be hailed by the hotel at no extra cost. "
"Recommended hotel for business and family vacation. The location is not far from downtown. Clean and quiet place, perfect for refreshing. The taste of food is very good. The staffs are so nice and friendly. 4 thumbs !!!!!"
"Great 5 star hotel with garden view and scenic golf course. Rooms are standard, but I love the balcony as it has garden/golf course views. My parents stayed in president suite room, which is very spacious. The service is excellent, staff are very helpful and friendly. Swimming pool is great, and they have gym too. The whirlpool is not great because the water temperature is the same as the swimming pool. The breakfast buffet is great, great variety. The only thing is that the waiting time for omelette is as they only have one chef making the omelette. Overall, really enjoyed my stay in this hotel."
"Simply perfect hotel. Top notch in every element, and for a very reasonable price. It&#39;s just outside the most busy areas of Yogya situated in beautiful grounds. It has everything you need: a big pool, good spa, sports facilities, tour agency in the lobby. The breakfast was good, as were the lunch options and the special bar for late afternoon drinks. They had a buffet with different theme every evening, which was - unlike the average hotel buffet - pretty good. One evening they even had a full-fledged Ramayana Ballet performance, including live musicians and a dozen actors. Most importantly, the staff was very friendly and experienced, and really made you feel at home."
On a golf tour of java we stayed at the hyatt and enjoyed a round of 9 holes on the very scenic golf course. Stayed in hyatt club rooms and the service and standard were excellent. Great beds very comfortable club lounge and a breakfast that will increase your waistline. The pool and gardens are sublime.
"Everything was perfect. Big 10 to Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. All staff member, including their manager, executives were treated guest like family.  Great view from all guest room windows (graden, swimming pool, golf course).  Kemangi Bistro restaurant which located outdoor faving to swimming pool are excellent, many great food selection. They‚Äôll make you stay from breakfast till lunch. Dinner was romantic within Kemangi"
"I stayed here in July/August 2017, and it remains one of the best hotels in customer service. The hotel and grounds are really spectacular (and do explore them if you stay here). A lot of those staying here do spend a lot of time around the pool (which isn&#39;t my thing, but it looked quite small for the amount of people in it). Buffet breakfast is excellent with a broad range of Asian and European. Dinner can also be spent here as the hotel is quite far from other restaurants. Food is fresh and quality is good (I ate here during my whole stay). Spa and hair treatments are also reasonably priced if you want to take advantage of those too. Rooms are spacious and clean, although somewhat outdated (bathrooms was particularly tatty) which is a real shame given the rest of the hotel is</span><span>&hellip;"
A nice experience of stay at Hyatt Regency Jogjakarta  Nice staff and managerial hotel. Variety of breakfast at Kemanggi Bistro. Spacious garden and golf view with ambience of Central Java   Need more rennovation especially room and bathroom  
"This hotel is a oasis in Jogyagarta. The gardens are beautiful and  reflect the culture and the temples near the city.  Food and spa service are so cheap, the only problema are the alcoholic drinks, the are very expensive compare to everything."
"This is a stunning hotel, beautifully decorated inside and out. It has great character, reflecting the city of Yogyakarta. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the food was very good. The hotel also put on great entertainment at weekends (we watched a traditional Indonesian Ramayana dance). Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Yogyakarta. "
"We just returned from a blissful holiday in Hyatt Regency , Yogyakarta and couldn&#39;t rave more about the excellent service and hospitality . From the moment we arrived, the staff went beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. The checkin was a breeze and the complimentary shoulder massage was a welcome treat . We were traveling as a family and throughout our stay, our 3 year old son was pampered by the staff who always greeted him by his name :) The resort itself was expansive and there were many activities to keep our toddler busy.. he enjoyed feeding the koi fishes, cycling around the golf course on the hotel&#39;s complimentary bikes, swimming in one of their many pools and even fishing in the pond (and releasing them back into the water) . Overall, it was a wonderful and</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed here for two nights.  We stayed in a non smoking room and had breakfast included.  The highlight for us was the waterslide at the swimming pool, and the friendly staff at the hotel, and our fantastic driver, who went above and beyond.  To top this off, we had some great food to eat."
"The hotel is great, but the rooms were noisy and in need of updating. Taps leaked, no milk for coffee and the linen was stained. Disappointing as this was my honeymoon. The staff were friendly and attentive, sometimes too attentive. When I revisit Yogja I will stay somewhere else."
The Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta is a luxury hotel close to the heart of the city.  It is quite an old place now and is a disappointing place to stay without the charm it may once have had.  Getting to the Hyatt Regency is not too difficult with an airport transfer.  It takes about 20 minutes.  Being well located the centre of town is not far away.  Check-in was fairly simple even through a travel agent booking.  Check-out was quick and efficient.  Service was friendly even if a return airport transfer had to be clarified a couple of times.  Confident English was spoken.  The room was ok.  Given this is a luxury hotel designed with the local Yogya aesthetic in mind it was nothing special.  The room was not especially large and was more functional than anything.  The design was</span><span>&hellip;
"As you leave Yogyakarta&#39;s airport and see the busy and stressed city (as an european) you don&#39;t expect to find such a place as Hyatt. Very quiet, peaceful, modern and very pleasant. The staff is the most friendly you can imagine and the hotel offers all the facilities one requires to relax and spend a good time. The favt that this hotel is nearby the city (although you don&#39;t notice it) is great because it gets you easily to the main city&#39;s attractions (which is the main purpose of tourists going there). "
"I , my family and friends stayed one night in August 2017.  We expected to have 5 stars luxury and comfortable room but the hotel&#39;s building is very old especially the bedroom. It&#39;s not worth for money I spent."
"If you want to have something elegant, patient and safety this is a good choice. Many pools, gym (!), nice garden, tasty and variable food in the restaurant, helpful staff. We enjoyed our 4 nights here. Good choice for a good price."
"First time I see this hotel, My doughter is in love with their pool. They have a great pool. And if you stay in Saturday, they will have Ramayana Ballet in their courtyard, you will love it. This hotel is very recomended."
the water knob in the bath tube is old and made my hand injured when i tried to turn it on for fill the tube with water. I also noticed that the taste of the food is not ok. the range of choice is not too much.
"We came here for our honeymoon. The location is sensational ! And the welcome was great. They gave us flowers necklace, and took a picture for us. In the room, there were rose petals all over the bed and in the bath. Was great. After our day, the picture was printed and on our desk with nice words from the crew. However, the prices are incredibly insane, come on 25 ‚Ç¨ for a 3 kg laundry ? That was really not good, and the bad point of the stay."
i am glad i choose Hyatt Regency Yogjakarta for my 1st trip to this city. it was a wonderful stay for us (family) and we appreciate all the staff efforts in making our 6 days stay memorable. TERIMA KASIH ..
"Hyatt Regency is great hotel and cozy place. The food is excellent , the staff is friendly and the room is clean. Have a great pool ( many pools), have a big and great garden. Nice place for kids to play around and have beautiful view for photo spot"
this is very good hotel with very nice staffs. the gardens are maintained very well. some activities offered are interesting. a bit far from down town but it has shutlle bus service for all guests. the food served are really good and vary. some nice restaurants are available near the hotel.
I really enjoyed my time at this property. It was so nice I almost regretted leaving to visit the town and temples. The breakfast spread is expansive and tasty. The large pool was always a pleasant reprieve from the midday heat. And the price is quite reasonable. I think this is my favorite Hyatt property after the Park Hyatts in Zanzibar and Vienna. High praise.
"We check in late 5pm and check out 2pm, the staff very helpful plus we get discount for breakfast and upgraded room attached with balcony. Hotel facilities very awesome. High security. Love it. Will stay again. "
"Would love to come again,love this hotel views and friendly staffs. Food was ok. Loved the attractions too. They have bike,pool table,golf and horse ride. The room was nice but little bit old need renovation little bit. Oveall happy customer"
I love their grand entrance with water fountains which you feel you are in a different world all together. Hotel staff are very nice and friendly. Super fast service. Cannot imagine another place with all these services.
"This was my second stay in this hotel. Gardens, pool, food, rooms, club service, price - everything is amazing. I have no complaints about these. But I had to cancel my booking sooner and move to a different hotel, because of huge construction site just beside the pool. I remember relaxing around the pool in past with just birds songs and the wind in the trees, but now it is like sitting in the middle of the construction site - sorry this was not relaxing stay. I do not blame hotel for renovating or upgrading the hotel, but that there is/was NO single word about this on hotel site or in emails (I communicated a lot with the hotel about my stay thru emails and no single info)."
"I recommend hyatt yogyakarta for family&#39;s trip. Nice pool, and Ramayana performance in every Sat was  memorable experience. Spa and massage was also nice. This hotels was best choice for my family."
"I visited this hotel for a meeting during a business trip to Yogjakarta and fell in love with it. I asked to see a room and decided that I will come back with my husband for a relaxing long weekend. After the mandatory visit to the Prambanan Temple (stunning!) and the Borobudur temple (equally stunning!), we stayed in the hotel all the time and had all our meals there. Ample facilities, great spaces, the walk around the 9-hole golf course (part of the hotel) was a favorite, amazing pools, etc.  The Regency lounge was excellent and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Note: the hotel is already quite old but has retained its charm.  Overall great value for money."
"Yes this hotel is worth a lot of stars, obviously it is expensive for Java norms, not for western norms. The grounds are stunning (integrated golf terrain), food is marvelous even when served as a buffet (for breakfast and dinners!). The personnel literally walksthe extra mile (e.g. to walk to another bar on the premised to get a coke zero for us).  We would like to thank chef Riva for the food that was prepared under his oversight and how proudly he shared with us how the kitchen is managed. Also the Fytra at the reception desk who helped us organize our trips to Borobudur and Prambanan (the transport piece).  The daily dinner buffets on the patio next to the pool are recommended - for a very affordable price, on Saturday we were lucky to watch the Ramayana tradional dance</span><span>&hellip;"
"I like to stay in Hyatt hotel Yogyakarta, the place is quiet ,the air is fresh and staff is helpful and friendly , very interesting for those who like jogging ,running or play golf .Every morning I can see mount Merapi form the window ,also a sunrise"
We got a good deal for four nights at the Hyatt Regency. We had a very relaxing stay and enjoyed the beautiful garden and pool area. Price for the dinner buffet is reasonable. Breakfast was really good. Drinks could be less expensive.
"Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is one of the best hotel in yogyakarta with great dan beautiful view of garden, golf course and wonderful swimming pool. It&#39;s great for family gathering / vacation, or business meeting.  with friendly staff and helpful!"
"Very nice hotel with comfortable rooms. Very good breakfast with a lot of choice. Pool is great with a nice slide as well as lots of shade. Spa was high quality and reasonable price (25 to 30‚Ç¨/ person for 1,5hr) Various shows for dinners and good food for a buffet. "
"Stayed with my 3-year old daughter at the hotel for 5 nights to visit Yogyakarta and surrounding highlights. We were with other family who stayed near by. We felt very welcome from the start till end. Staff is very friendly and helpful, food is good and rooms are clean! I would for sure stay here again."
"A very good hotel, highly recommended for family vacations, as well as a memorable breakfast and activity experience. Do not forget to try out the spa and the real thrill of golfing. This is indeed a very good hotel"
"This is a great place to stay  with  good  landscaping that makes your stay so much more relaxing . Rooms are big  and have good garden views , must ask at check in  Wifi pretty fast Breakfast  not much for non Indonesian guests ...considering this is a Five Star property  Room service  very good with good food options . The tour desk is of  no use  and Hotel must keep a tab on him . Porters there but least interested in taking care of guests luggage .. for brown skinned  guests ."
"It is difficult to think of any negatives about this hotel. It&#39;s close to the city but with a rural feel and absolutely beautiful gardens and pool area. Another big plus is world class sightseeing within a short drive. Bedrooms are comfortable with plenty of storage space and have a good size, user friendly bathroom. Food in both Regency Club and the main restaurant was excellent and the meals were one of the highlights of our day. However, best of all were the utterly lovely staff who made sure we enjoyed every moment of our three-week visit. They helped create memories to last a lifetime."
"Hyatt Regency is set in lush gardens and has unique architecture inspired by nearby Borobudur. In particular the swimming pool has a replica of the ancient temple, together with slides connecting multi level pools. Enjoyable for a day at the pool. The food is good and the rooms are first rate too. "
"My family (two girls aged 9 and 7) stayed here for two months. We couldn&#39;t have been happier with the service we received from everyone at the hotel from the General Manager down. We were made to feel very at home, offered food that wasn&#39;t on the menu and enjoyed our stay immensely. I would highly recommend this hotel for families because it is large, has lush green surrounds and what I&#39;m sure is the best pool in Yogyakarta, perhaps even Java."
My family and I celebrated my birthday in Jogja and I made the right choice to stay in Hyatt Regency it was an awesome place for family nice big pool and scenery we had a great time the staff were all welcoming.
"I feel welcomed by the staffs when we checked in , and everything is okay with this hotel, just 1 mosquitos disturb us in the room for the whole stay haha. But over all me and my family are very happy"
"We stayed here twice either side of volcano trekking . The hotel is 6k outside of the centre ( Maoliboro road ) but provide a useful shuttle to and from . We booked a club room which was spacious and well equipped . The pool is innovative and split into 4 parts with water slides etc this makes it ideal for kids ( and there were loads of them ) but not very good to laze around . We ate in the main restaurant which was quite bland and had breakfast there once - I would recommend to have breakfast in the club , the service is quicker and you have a small chance of the food being hot ! We found the staff all very friendly and helpful and welcomed us back on our second visit like lost family - very lovely ! I would recommend a club room , the drinks and food in the evening are very</span><span>&hellip;"
"From concierge to food, everything included comfortable amenities &amp; the room it was fabulous. And then there&#39;s the great infused waters in the lounge and the yummy popcorn at the pool. We used the kids care service; my son enjoyed his time while we went into town to shop or to the nearby ruins. They provide everything."
"We enjoyed our stay here for 3 nights, staff were friendly and the food was good.  Free shuttle service to Maoliboro and Andong ride around the compound.  Staff at the restaurants are attentive &amp; the food prices are also reasonable.  Wonderful view from our room seeing Mt Merapi, surely will be back here if visit Jogja again.  Thanks a lot."
"After having nice experience for business trip in this hotel last year, I brought my whole family to have Hyatt&#39;s way in this hotel. Originally we reserved only for 2 days during the peak Idul Fitri season... And we just extended our stay 1 day more because we&#39;re all happy with Hyatt&#39;s way.  The room is spacious, very comfortable bed, nice views from room, fast WIFI, clean and quiet. Bathroom is nice.  Breakfast is excellent with lots of variety. Even I was a bit late to have breakfast, they still serve with lots of meals, indoor or outdoor.  I did morning walk and jogging along the golf course and found Secret Garden with many old sculptures of Hindu deities and Buddha. And many more fantastic gardens which are soooo instagrammable.  The Staffs are so friendly and kind. One of</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks for the first time.Recalling, I went to Hawaii last year the second time. The experience was devastating because of an outragiously expensive charge and the cold, indifferent attitude of the staff of the hotel where I stayed. I think the hotels and their people there have come to be that way due to too much demand compared with too little supply. Coming to this hotel this time, I noticed first of all that the staff are invariably attentive, polite, smiling and ready to help me, positively acting, anticipating beforehand what I would want and need. The hotel is sort of ideal in that it is located in the outskirts secluded from the hustles and bustles of the city, and that it has quite a vast and spacious space, having a golf course, swimming</span><span>&hellip;"
"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful stay.  The grounds are lovely, with a meandering swimming pool, table tennis, gym, aviary, walking trail, and golf club.  Mount Merapi is visible in the distance.  The staff are attentive and friendly.  The breakfast buffet was delicious, serving a variety of Indonesian and continental breakfast items.  Especially helpful was an onsite travel agency, which booked drivers and day excursions on short notice at affordable rates.   The resort is conveniently located for travel to Borobudur, Mount Merapi,  Prambanan, and the airport.  We ate one excellent dinner at the hotel restaurant, and another at the restaurant Sasanti, a very short walk and directly adjacent to the hotel.  I highly recommend a stay here and would return."
"It was my first time staying here and this time we chose them for our holiday trip in Jogja.  They were very welcoming from the front to the back. Their concierge was considerably quick. It took only a few minutes from check in paper to entering my room.  I enjoyed their hospitality during my stay. Though the property looks a bit tired, I might say they brought in local generosity into the property very well.  A little note for them: 1. Enrich variety of breakfast menu 2. Consider renovation, i.e. make rooms bigger, update interior. 3. Expand room inventory, i.e. convert golf land bank into rooms and make a driving range only.  Cheers  "
"Lush, comfy hotel, much greenery, great for family vacation: it has great pool for kids and adult, excellent breakfast spread and variety, many restaurants nearby, provides shuttle to malioboro - from there you can go to Beringharjo market, Keraton, Vredeburg, and Taman Sari. Good start point to explore Ullen Sentalu museum, Prambanan - Borobudur and Ratu Boko temple as you don&#39;t have to pass city central."
"I stayed for 2 nights. I had the room with the balcony. Their unique architecture is beautiful, the room is spacious but what I really like is the quietness.  The breakfast are delicious The staff are also very friendly and helpful."
"This is such a lovely hotel.  We stayed five nights and paid a little extra for a Club Regency room and benefits.  It was really worth it and would have liked to stay longer.  We enjoyed everything about our stay here, starting with the arrival process, the entrance/lobby areas are stunning, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was spacious with large ceiling to floor windows and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Good WiFi was accessible though out the resort.  There was plenty of choices for breakfast which changed each morning.  There was a great range of beverages and food in the Club lounge for complementary cocktail each evening.  The pool is stunning with a tasteful waterslide and gardens.  There is a walk-through bird aviary with very cute white</span><span>&hellip;"
"I will come to hyatt. It definitely our best moment when staying here. Complete our vacation with great memories. Hotel area is prime with nature sight seeing and alot of sport we could do, kids loves it"
"It&#39;s such an exquisite hotel with beautiful greenery. I love the swimming pool so much and so did my kids. My oldest son would rather stay in the hotel all day long than to go outside. The deluxe room is big enough to accommodate 2 adults and 2 children (age 0-4). Hair cutting was good, SPA was amazing, and that breakfast buffet every morning was such a feast. "
I had an excellent experience from beginning to end. The staff were helpful and friendly. The staff provided me with immediate assistance for either information or  The food was delicious and with a wide variety of choice!
"Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is located in a sprawling property that offers beautiful gardens and Javanese representations. It is a little far from downtown Yogyakarta and is probably one of the earlier chain hotels established in the city. As such, public areas and guest rooms are obviously in need of some sprucing up though cleanliness was not an issue during my visit. The hotel staff were very warm and welcoming that easily put guests in a relaxed and pleasant disposition. The restaurant serves Indonesian, Balinese and western cuisine that could satisfy one&#39;s craving for authentic food. "
"I stayed at Hyatt Regency for company event. It wad the 2nd time I stayed there. The 1st time was in 2008 for honeymoon.  The staff was friendly, the food was tasty and delicious, the room was clean  Although it is an old hotel, I was really enjoyed it.  During the event, the serve the best mie godog in town.  After corporate event, some of my friend and I continue our adventure, hiking to mount Merbabu. The hotel alloed us to leave our luggage there.   For next trip to Jogja, definitely Insyaa Allah I will stay there again. "
"Simply excellent. Hotel and staff are professional but also friendly, and the grounds (esp. the pool) are perfect for families to relax in.  The building is not as swanky as some of the other newer hotels but it has a grand old charm.  Highly recommended. Will definitely be visiting again."
"You dont need to go anywhere.. Great pools, for kids, adult. Great food. Golf course, tennis court, fitness, 2 km jogging tracks, kids fishing pools, small soccer field..etc etc.. Very relaxing and make you dont to go anywhere..just stay and enjoy the Hotel facilities. However, I got sleep qualty problem, because noisy music sound, from Golf Club Bars, which has no wall building."
"The a la carte was bad. Fatty rendang, tom yung soup poor taste, no chicken. Tiny chocolate lava. Not hot, not really a lava at all. No frigging pisang goreng. Ok, so u run out of bananas? Got blamed for faulty key, had to go down twice. "
"very good to stay for  family vacation and buisnees, location is near city and good to sport too...and we will come back soon for vacation good meal and good show or event is very best. the pool and golf court is very good"
"Great hotel, in heart of Jogja and striking distance from the main sites. Everything works, and staff, facilities etc excellent, at reasonable 4-5 star prices! Especially nice if you have sampling the more local guest houses before (recommended too!)."
"This hotel is spacious, have big ballroom,  other meeting room and spaces which is make it suitable for any big event such as conference or others. The room itself is standard, a bit old, nothing special but comfy. Breakfast selections are good and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  "
"Very huge area and connected to the golf course. If you bring the kids, they gonna love it because of the surroundings and many activities they can do there. Things that we tried: glamping, cycling, fishing, and swimming. We all love the slides! You can literally stay there without going elsewhere. The room is old and i hope there&#39;ll be some renovations :) nonetheless, all of us is enjoying our stay. Definitely will come back."
"I&#39;m not one to exaggerate, but I have never stayed at a hotel with friendlier people. Indonesians are incredibly friendly overall, but this hotel staff went out of its way to make me feel welcome. At check in, the staff walked me over to a couch so I could sit and drink some juice while they filled out my registration. Walking to the elevator, I was greeted by three hotel staff members who acted like I was a long lost friend. It really was amazing.  The rooms were great. The cost was very, very reasonable. The restaurant was awesome.   I was very, very pleased with the entire trip."
"The restaurant currently under maintenance (feb 2017)  I hate the locking system of my room  This is my second time stayed at Hyatt Yogyakarta,   i got trouble with the key scanner, the scanner are old and make some trouble, so you need to keep trying many times until the door are unlock, and i also inform the housekeeping and engineering to open the door, the fact is They need to changing a new one.  The hotel was good, service good.  "
"Arrival 5/5. Swift and efficient check in. They let us check in early.  Room 4/5. Room 205 Club Room. Typical high quality business room. Good size comfy bed with nice linen. We slept very well. TV with lots of channels including CNN &amp; BBC World. Minibar/fridge and digital safe. Plenty of storage. Iron &amp; board. Stylish Indonesian robes &amp; slippers. Desk/chair with separate lounge chair. No balcony, but pleasant views over the lovely gardens.   Bathroom 4/5. A good size, with a very nice, large walk in shower and full size separate bath. Quality toiletries and soft towels. Lovely floor tiles. Hairdryer. Shaving mirror.   Pool 4/5. A very interesting area with lots of small pools and sunbathing areas. Some lovely Prambanan style structures in the grounds.   Club lounge 5/5. Superb.</span><span>&hellip;"
"The only saving grace with this hotel is its architecture, landscape &amp; the staff.   The rooms badly need an upliftment (very basic, lacks modernness) .. and its not even such an old property for its rooms &amp; toilets to look so worn out.   decent breakfast, lovely poolside area and an outdoor sit-out.   Centrally placed and makes it a great place for a tranquil stay in an otherwise crazy city of Jogja"
"Amazing stay. Beautiful grounds, helpful staff. rooms are a little outdated and a bit dark - could do with more light.    The staff were always happy to help and the spa was brilliant   One of the let downs was the breakfast, there wasn&#39;t much continental choice available and limited fresh fruits.   The hotel offer a shuttle service into town - but with only 7 spaces and no more! We were a family of 5 and were told they didn&#39;t have space for us all so we should pay and get a taxi into town which I didn&#39;t agree with at all. As a hotel  guests I felt they should cater to the guests- how can they expect half to go by taxi and half by the shuttle?   But they were brilliant in Sorting out another car for us once our concerned were shared .  Over all lovely place to stay and will be</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stay 4 days 3 nights.  It is a old 5 star hotel.  Room clean enough. Nice service. So many choice for food. But in 3 Times breakfast, the menu was  almost same..little bit boring. It have jogging track. Wonderfull view. It&#39;s Nice to stay here."
We stay for two nights here to visit a family at the end of ramadhan. Check in was really quick and smooth. Our room is immaculately clean at the regency club wing facing the golf course green and surprisingly very quiet! Staff at the regency club are very attentive and friendly. Even gave us a late check out on the last minutes. No problem at all. Hope to come back soon.
"The hotel is nice and really quite, with a beautiful pool and a golf course.  The rooms needs to be renowned, are sure more than 25 years old.  The food is ok with many choices, surely not the best but not the worst. Don&#39;t expect a clean napkin."
"Set in beautiful gardens with it&#39;s own golf course, the public areas of the hotel are excellent. The staff are also excellent and very helpful. However, the lower room categories really do let the hotel down. The bedrooms are fine, with comfortable beds, but the bathrooms really need upgrading, as they are at best 3*. The shower is in the bath, and just has a shower curtain, not what I expect in a 5* hotel, but the biggest disappointment was that after a very hectic few days, the bath I was really looking forward to didn&#39;t happen, because firstly the plug refused to stay in place, and secondly there wasn&#39;t any hot water, no matter how long I ran the tap. If I had been staying more than a night, I would have asked to change rooms, but instead it just marred my experience of what</span><span>&hellip;"
"Really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Regency.  Its a lovely property with a nice swimming pool and a wonderful spa  The swimming pool is themed on Borobudur and has nice carvings throughout.  I really enjoyed the spa...would recommed the Royal Javanese treatment...you do feel royal after that !  The Hotel organizes a free shuttle to Marloboro Street for shopping...this is highly recommended to get a true feel of Yogyakarta.  Being a vegetarian, the dining options are a bit limited...but the chefs do a great job nevertheless"
"The reason I chose to come back to Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta after 10years: The waterslide. I felt like a kid again.  The price of the hotel is awesome as well.  From the welcome with jasmine flower garland to the daily infused water, the attentive staff are all really awesome.  They even have a ping pong table by the pool.  We were so graciously provided with an early check in as my friend arrived at 7am from Bangkok on an overnight flight. It was really precious to him as he cannot sleep on flights or airports. Thank you so very much, Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. We had a huge room with a balcony. So awesome to have coffee outside listening to the birds chriping. I wish they have an outdoor jacuzzi. (Maybe Hyatt Regency can consider.). We arranged for a wake up call at 3am and the</span><span>&hellip;"
"Very warm welcome received when I arrive late around 9pm. Although very tired, the waiting for check in was rather long around 10 mins. In general, this hotel is great and value for money. Rooms with garden view is nice. The landscaping around the hotel area is very Javanese feel. It is a good choice if you have family and kids to stay in this hotel. The location is rather away from the main city streets, it make a perfect gateaway resort. Breakfast serves a variety of local food. A must try as an introduction before you go out try any restaurant in Malioboro street. Although rooms are a bit old fashion with the design, the facilities are in good condition. Hot water comes almost immediately."
We were lucky to stay two nights in this beautiful hotel &amp; was suggested by our son. Hotel is 30 minutes away from the Yogyakarta airport &amp; we went to Borobudur in 45 minutes. We enjoyed every minute in this hotel. 
"Staying here with a friend right now. Any and all staff members are warm, smiling, professional, and attentive. Really, the most amazing staff experience you can imagine. And although we haven&#39;t met, the people who work in housekeeping look after the smallest details when fixing up your room. Even my computer cable was properly wrapped up and put back where I had left it. Plus fresh apples in the room every day. Yum.  As for the room, the bed is super comfy, and we have a large adjoining balcony with a table. I was out working there over coffee in the wee hours, the sounds of the calls to prayer (Muslim country, so you hear that a lot), perfect weather, and a gorgeous view in the morning. Really perfect. The hotel grounds are also like few I&#39;ve seen. Perfectly maintained.  </span><span>&hellip;"
"We are staying just 2 weeks before Lebaran, which is in the fasting month. When we came here the first thing we felt so comfortable with all the trees and fresh air, we were greeted right from the lobby and they gave us necklaces of jasmine flowers. The check-in process was very nice and since we book the regeny club room, we were able to enjoy all the facilities in the club lounge for free such as Tea and Coffee also they serve afternoon snacks from 5 to 7 pm (really love this part). The room was kind of old-fashioned and not so big but it is very clean (they provide smoking room, so make sure to ask for non-smoking floor if you are not smoking), we got the wi-fi for free also. Bathroom amenities were quite complete and they restock them daily. The swimming pool were awesome,</span><span>&hellip;"
"Beautiful location near Mount Merapi and large well laid out gardens. Great pool, part of which winds through the trees. Nice 9 hole golf course also a pleasure to be on. Food good. Staff very friendly and helpful."
We stay here for best friend wedding in mid of Feb 2017. Hotel with Java ambiance. Got the room quite far from elevator. Room quite spacious with closet for clothes. Aircon was bit too cold for Indonesian. Breakfast is nice with more Indonesian taste. Service OK. Quite far from city center.
"I am a Hyatt Globalist and have been to dozens and dozens of Hyatts around the world. I have been to top Hyatt like the Park Hyatt Sydney, PH Tokyo, PH Beijing, PH Shanghai, PH Chicago, PH Siem Reap, GH Doha, PH Abu Dhabi, PH Dubai, etc, etc. I love Hyatts. But the HR Yogyakarta takes the cake as the best value Hyatt in the whole world. This is an objectively wonderful hotel! The staff are extremely nice and helpful. The property is beautiful. The rooms are great. The prices of not only the room, but on-property services like restaurant, spa, salon, etc, etc simply blew me away. If you&#39;re in Yogyakarta (and you should definitely visit Yogyakarta; Prambanan and Borobudur are two of the top UNESCO sites in the world) staying at the Hyatt is an absolute no-brainer. Do not miss it.</span><span>&hellip;"
"Hyatt always been my first choice to stay in Yogyakarta. Been here for three times, and i really enjoying all my times there. Good hospitality from all the staffs, clean room, great breakfast, and has the best swimming pool. Staffs were welcoming you since you arrived by gave you welcoming flowers and drinks. Room a bit moist, so you have to turn on the ac all he time to reduce the moist. Bed was fluffy and comfortable. One night, our toilet bowl didn&#39;t drain properly, staffs were just came right away in a second and fixed up the problem. And the next day they gave you a complimentary cookies and ginger candies for the inconvenient caused. "
"We heard from our guide that this is the best garden hotel in Yogyakarta and we totally agreed.  A pity we did not make full use of the facilities (outdoor pool, Jacuzzi etc) during our stay there. Excellent hotel spa provided. Only cons is the breakfast spread. It can be improved for a 5* hotel."
It is becoming obvious that asset maintenance and upgrade expenses are being keep to a minimum. The staff are doing an excellent job under these conditions. Convenient to the airport. Shuttle bus schedule to downtown not so reliable. Best to take taxi.
"The hotel is very nice sitting on a golf course very beautiful grounds, the staff 5 star very helpful and always happy, I can not say enough about the staff very nice all of them , food 3 star this is the area that the hotel need to address, they must know as the owners do go to other hotels if you truly want to be a 5 star this is the area that needs to be fixed, food is OK but much room for improvement."
"For the beautiful grounds and the impeccable service and friendliness of the staff alone, i would give the hotel a 10/10, however the rooms leave a little to be desired! Rooms need to be refurbished and thoroughly cleaned desperately! I was surprised by the standard of the rooms at the Hyatt and the deceptiveness of their photographs on tripadvisor and their website. The sofa in our room was very dirty as were the curtains. The bathrooms have a rather dated feel to them as well and are rather in need for an immediate upgrade.  The grounds and the pool though are fantastic! Great for lounging about and would be ideal for an outdoor event. The food was fantastic as well! All in all, while the rooms are not up to the standard of the Hyatt, the grounds, service and food are all</span><span>&hellip;"
"An old structure, but well maintained and functional.  A good architecture matching with the local culture, in the middle of lush vegetation, with a bonus golf course. he pool has several quiet corners to relax or a nice slide to enjoy the aquatic fun. Personnel is very gently, smiley and incredible friends.  They want you to feel home and they succeed. Food is good. Breakfast buffet provide you with anything you may think of and the quality is amazing. I travel a lot and sleep in hotel quite often: this is one of those plays that immediately conquer the highest part of the my personal rank."
"I was impressed how beautiful the grounds and pool were at this hotel, due to the very reasonable price we paid. Our room was fine with nice views, the staff was friendly and helpful, and I was happy to not be in the thick of town. I was glad to get back to the peace of this place every day. Great value for the price."
"The hotel is amazing setting, the staff happy to help and warm welcome , the swimming pool is gorgeous , restaurant good choice of food delicious as well , the view from the roof top beautiful especially sunrise and sunset "
"This is the hotel I always pick if I go to Yogyakarta. It&#39;s a modern hotel with a touch of traditional elements. Good landscaping, nice pools, picturesque view. There is a free shuttle service to jalan Malioboro."
Overall very nice experience. Good selection and variety of food. Staff are very sincere in providing great service. The only comment I have is hotel looks tired and needs a good facelift especially the toilets. Stay in the club rooms located on higher floor and request was see through. 
Great service at the Hyatt!  Took free shuttle to Malioboro St.  Took horse drawn carriage ride around the premise.  Walked the trail with the secret garden.  Breakfast had a lot of different cuisine selection.  
"Beautiful landscape and few swimming pools for adults and children. There is even an outdoor jacuzzi. The kids club organizes exciting activites for kids such as horse riding, golf putting, fishing, kite flying, etc. Perfect for parents to leave their kids in the hotel while going shopping or massage. Wide spread of buffet breakfast and dinner with traditional ramayana ballet performance. Although room was a bit outdated but overall staying experience was great. "
"Great staff wonderful food.   The hotels is a bit dates but the staff and the food more than make up for it.  It is a great place to unwind after a long dates sight seeing.   It is located close to the airport and town, but you wouldn&#39;t know it once you enter the property.  I would definitely stay again !"
"Hotel looks amazing from inside as well as outside. Huge area. Very good pool area. Check in staff was very good offered us welcome drinks and lady front office manager was also very polite. Special thanks to housekeeping who was looking after my room.  You guys are the best. Plus complimentary shuttle for borubudur(sorry for spelling wrong, if I amüòÅ) was a plus point.  Have a lot to say about the beautiful property.  Surely recommended..."
"First time we have stayed as a family. Currently having a great time, im able ton play Golf in the morning, kids swim all day! Enough things for the kids to stay happy, they love the food, and my wife and i are able to relax. Staff are great, nothing is a hassle. No negatives at all, We Will Be back!"
"The golf course is right next to the hotel and the hotel swimming pool can entertain the children throughout our stay, so in all a very enjoyable stay. The room is a bit outdated but well maintained. We feel looked after by the hotel staff who were very polite and friendly. Breakfast was excellent with generous variety of Western and Asian food, I really like the Javanese fried rice. Very tasty!"
"Stayed at this hotel just for a night, as stop over in Yogya.  Preferred this hotel due to the Hyatt brand and me being a member (which was sadly not recognized).  The hotel complex itself is huge. we were given a warm welcome and were served a fruit punch while the checking formalities were getting done. star one for the property. The room  was decent sized, albeit on a smaller end.  Room had all the amenities we need. The bathroom was stocked with the essential supplies for a traveler. That&#39;s star 2 for the property. We had dinner at the restaurant and the food was good. we had ordered simple italian and the taste was good. The staff at the restaurant and at the lobby were very nice and helpful. Thats star 3 for the property.   That&#39;s where the stars stop.  The room had water</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed in this hotel many times, and always love the lush greenery of the properties. Given that Yogyakarta is now so jammed, packed and crowded (but the city is a place I love to visit now and then) - staying in Hyatt is relaxing and refreshing. It is located rather suburbs, but now the surrounding is developed too with many good restaurants. It has shuttle car to Malioboro (main road of Yogya), if you care for using the facility. Otherwise its plenty taxi to order from or even Uber taxi. Afterall, with the development of Yogya city - the location is not too remote anyway Morning stroll in the property is nice, followed by breakfast in the garden."
Truly enjoyed my stay at Hyatt Jogja. (This is my 1st trip to Jogja) Quiet and tranquil location which my wife and I like. Nice scenic surroundings as well. Will come back and stay here again. And not forgetting to try a round of golf within the hotel. *Thumbs-Up*
"I have been staying at this hotel regularly formore than 7 years, the reasons are that it is a Great Hotel for any purpose whether you are solo or with family or friends. Great food and service, a beauitful place to relax and just enjoy life!"
"Really love hyatt regency yogya highly recomended specially for family vacation. All family members needs can be fulfilled in this hotel no need leave the hotel.Every body happy from adult to kids. Mommy happy, daddy happy and kid happy"
As part of the hyatt group I was disappointed. I agree the hotel is located on a beautiful property with lush greenery and suited by the golf course and giving guest a resort feel but the rooms are old and abit run down. As Hyatt members we got upgraded and was disappointed with the conditioned of the room. The room smelt mouldy as we had leaking in the toilet. Since we are only staying for a short time so we didn&#39;t bother changing the room. The walls were so thin and we could hear the guest next room taking their showers and talking.  We have been given the room at the far end of the corridor and golfers wakes up very early to play golf have to go in and out passing our room making it so noisy. The service of the hotel is good with lovely staffs but they really need to upgrade</span><span>&hellip;
"The Hyatt Regency in Jogjakarta (Yogyakarta) is lovely. The entry takes you past koi ponds into a spacious lobby. The sraff welcomed us with jasmine leis and fruit punch while we checked in. Our room was comfortable and clean with a large balcony overlooking the pool.The restaurant had a generous breakfast buffet and the dinner menu was extensive with both Indonesian and international offerings. Overall, a pleasant stay."
"Booked a stay for my parents anniversary. Their customer relations staffs were prompt in responding to my emails and accommodating to my request. Similarly, the staffs on the ground were lovely and courteous so really can&#39;t find any fault in this area. The hotel has a vast, well maintained garden area which was excellent for a morning walk before breakfast, which itself was very fulfilling with the large options available - i&#39;d say the general restaurant is better than the club lounge for breakfast. Overall, very satisfied and would love to come back again."
I would like to thanks Hyatt Regency Yogya for the great experience &amp; services. Truly enjoyed my stay for 4 nights.. Most of the guest don&#39;t really goes for the hotel structured but goes for the service &amp; most of the dept really care bout their guest.. From frontline to housekeeping to restaurant.. They really listen &amp; study what guests needs.. Especially Ms Fitry the Guest Experience Manager who really cares bout her guest so do her teams. She bring me to tour the hotel explain every single things.. Meet their Front office Manager Ms Catherina for a quick chat bout how the stay given me some tips where to go what to do. Was invited for their VIP cocktail at Bogey teras correct me if im wrong for the name.. hahaha.. &amp; yeah the restaurants staff do come to me to check hows the</span><span>&hellip;
"As part of Hyatt chain, this hotel has offered great place to stay and to pamper ourselves. Located in prominent area in Yogyakarta, so guest can walk around to city center with not too far distance. Yet, this hotel is quite old building need to be renovated to make the guest feel more comfort to stay"
"grounds and building are incredible. Like a temple. You can eat meals at not great expense. Staff so helpful for any questions most fluent in english.rooms comfortable looking out into the grounds. Nice pool, exercise room. AC is a must and kept us sawy from humid days."
PLUSES 20mins from Malioboro Street (with free hotel shuttle) Food (buffet) is good and inexpensive Nice pool &amp; large amount of open green space in the middle of the city!  Great service  DOWNSIDE - a little old - Health Centre (Spa) old and a little chaotic
"This hotel fits for family, couples and others... But considering the room price that is quite expensive...you should spend more time in this hotel...don&#39;t leave hotel to long ;D  The room is cozy, they have big swimming pool, golf and big garden with very nice view. And they have a very nice breakfast food &amp; ambiance"
The indoor air conditioning of the hotel needs to be looked into do that the guests feel comfortable walking indoors or sit around the hotel.  They need to make it colder in public indoor areas inside the hotel.   Lifts are old and slow but tolerable. 
"Big hotel with friendly staff. We spent day just in the hotel. Swimming, riding a bike, fishing, riding &quot;delman&quot; or just relax and reading under the tree... The food so good, they have local/traditional food and drink if you want try something different."
"This was our 2nd visit to Yogyakarta but our first at this hotel. It was short break but wished it was longer as we truly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Special mention was the excellent breakfast spread with local and international morning variety of dishes. The other was not to be missed the Ramayana Cultural dance/show which was packaged together with sumptuous dinner of local and Indonesian cuisines. The dance ballet was excellent but the only drawback was that the traditional Ramayana dance (with live traditional musical accompaniment) was held at the same level as the dining area. Had it been held on a stage or on elevated platform, it would have been more entertaining. The dinner buffet spread was excellent and so much food to saviour from. Apart from that, the overall</span><span>&hellip;"
"This was a good hotel to use as base when visiting Yogja with small children. In between Borobudur and Prambanan, and with great pool and green areas for when the kids need a break from all the cultural activities. Friendly and service minded staff. Not full score as some potential to improve maintenance standards, but not a big issue for us"
"It was really our short enjoyable stay. The check in &amp; check out process were quick and efficient. The staffs were very friendly &amp; attentive. We found the room was very nice and complete amenities. We also enjoyed the vary buffet breakfast, including the fresh juice that made on the spot. We will definitely come back here for our next Yogya trip."
"The first impression of this hotel is breath-taking.  From the outside it is elegant and beautifully designed.  As you walk to the reception, you pass ponds with carp and artefacts reminiscent of the temple at Borobudur.  The grounds are beautiful with a golf course on site.  Inside the hotel though, there are signs of wear and tear and our room, whilst exceptionally clean, was a little shabby in its d√©cor.  Our toilet overflowed and flooded the bathroom - twice - and although it was attended to, the problem was not fixed and it was only after complaining several times that we were moved to a different room.  The food was excellent though, the service attentive.  Whilst there, there was an &#39;Indonesian Street Food&#39; event which was thoroughly enjoyable with entertainment at a very</span><span>&hellip;"
"very good hotel . golf course , gardens , landscaping are wonderfool.wonderful staff .was here for a week and enjoyed the daily breakfast , ultimate outdoors . bar location is very good . this hotels has one of the largest property areawise . golf course adds to it .  "
"Jogjakarta is acknowledged as the heart of the Javanese culture, residing on its cultural heritage as one of the remaining kingdoms in Java. Hyatt is situated on the outskirts of Jogjakarta, embracing the mountainous view of Merapi, an active volcano that acts as the benevolent protector of the kingdom. The hotel was inaugarated in 1997, and retain a classic resort type of accomadation. Surrounding the hotel is a vast acre for golf and outdoor walks. Food and beverages are standarized, and well served."
"excellent facility a must stay in Jogja. wonderful grounds to walk around and explore all the plants and flowers, also a bird aviary  wonderful breakfast with a wide selection of food choices for all cultures. you wont be disappointed here"
Nice hotel. Friendly staff. Approximately 20 minutes from marker. Food is mediocre.  The hotel needs to work on improving the quality of the food. Tried different dishes and they all had same bland taste. Otherwise nice place. 
"A very well maintained old hotel, everything&#39;s up to the high standard of the brand. Check in and check out process were done fast, courteous and attentively. Love the green scenery and relaxing, tranquil surrounding. The location reminds me of Ubud, Bali, with lots of restaurants and caf√© along the street."
"The service was top notch. Food and drinks were always served in the lounge. Good spread of food for the buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner.   Do take note that the water is not potable in Indonesia and many hotels and restaurants cut corners by making their own ice using the undrinkable tap water, resulting in diarrhea for those who consume the ice. But not for Hyatt. Hyatt operates on a higher set of protocols and always buys their ice (according to the waitresses I spoke to). No diarrhea here. But when we moved to Swiss-Belair hotel at Yogjakarta the following 2 days after our visit at Hyatt Regency, I was struck with diarrhea from the ice from Swiss-Belair. So food and drink standards at Hyatt are number 1 in Yogjarta.  Now for the facilities. For those who like old hotels</span><span>&hellip;"
"Went to Yogyakarta city last November 2016 as part of a business trip, stayed in Hyatt Regency for 3 nights.  Arrived on a rainy evening, which made the hotel ambiance even more stunning! The hotel true charm could be better highlighted during the night, providing you a mysterious, yet warm and relaxing ambiance from their front reception to your artistically decorated room.   Cleanliness in the room itself was excellent, no yellowish stain or other problems that you can easily found in a dated hotel. Perhaps some of the facilities within the bathroom, especially the shower and toilet, could be rejuvenated to convey a better message of antique instead of old.  Breakfast was excellent, menu selection keep changing everyday, with a unique Indonesian traditional corner that you</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed in this hotel as a family of four (2 young boys) in the week of 10th March.  The hotel is a about 20-30 minutes from the airport due to traffic.  It is actually located in a relatively busy road, but the hotel entrance is a bit deep inside so the feeling is a lot more relaxing once we reached hotel.  Tired looking but clean and greeneries around like typical Hyatt.  Beautiful and clean pool.  Really friendly and helpful staff.  Our room was on the second floor overlooking its garden.  The room itself was nice and clean, our extra bed came almost immediately.  Bathroom was very tired looking and need to be renovated as the taps, toilet suite and shower heads need replacement.  The breakfast was fantastic, it has everything for everyone.  I love its local breakfast</span><span>&hellip;"
"For the number of amenities this place offers it is incredible value, and there&#39;s a lot of fun to be had in the pool, on the slides and the various sports and activities - a clear highlight being the pillow fighting over the swimming pool. The service was fine, without being anything special and the food was inconsistent (the Rendang was excellent, but some of the other dishes were either a bit dry or a bit soggy). The rooms are spacious and clean, and again - excellent value. However, it needs someone to look at the smaller details which could elevate this into a really swanky hotel - the service around the pool is really poor, the gym, communal bathrooms and spa area have rank and tattered towels on the floor instead of bathmats, there is one random empty Absolut Vodka bottle</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed there for ten days . Ten enjoyable and unforgettable days. We enjoyed walking among the paths in theses marvelous gardens around of the gulf. We relaxed with messages among the gardens in a seperated place. Excellent food , nice service Very friendly staff."
"Although the hotel is more than 20 years old, the overall cleanliness of the hotel is maintained very well. I visited this hotel early 2000 but more than 15 years later it is still at the same conditions. Good job for the management and staff. Hope to visit this hotel again in the future."
"Great hotel in the middle of the city but once you enter, you completely forget being in a city, it is....heaven. Warm welcome with a necklace of flowers, quick and accurate check-in. Standard rooms are ok, a bit outdated bathrooms. Great breakfast with an enormous choice. The friendliness of the staff is remarkable, they really care about you."
"It&#39;s very nice hotel. The venue is huge, they have gardens, golf fields, swimming pools, restaurants and bars. I would definitely stay there again. The restaurant has a good menue with a lot of choices and after dinner you can relax at the bar with live music. There is a travel agency at the lobby that can help you to kill the time. They organized for us whole transportation plus guided trips to Borobodur and Prambanan temples. The guides were great. The only minus I will give them for the check-in time. It took us more than 30 minutes to check in. They offered us refreshing towels, juice drinks etc but still it should be done faster."
"I love Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for the cleanliness of the room even though you know that the rooms are quite old already, the ambiance which is calming in Javanese nuance at tropical environment and also for the big and lovely pool which in enjoyable for kids and adults.   Breakfast selection also quite good, don&#39;t miss out the JAMU (Javanesse herbal drinks)"
"A truly fantastic place, staff were just amazing &amp; the breakfast was out of this world. The breakfast staff remembered how I have my coffee after the first morning and would great me every morning with the best coffee and amazing service..would very highly recommend staying here!"
"If you&#39;re planning to stay at the Hyatt Regency, expect a very calming and soothing nuance we can get from the landscape. Very nice place to stay and to attend conferences; service was great, the ballroom was big enough to get everyone in. One thing though, I feel like the food sometimes are plain, and the bedroom was rather small than I thought. Outside toilets are not that great as well; probably because there were so many people using it, but I certainly feel like my office&#39;s toilets are cleaner"
"This Hotel was wonderful - quiet, lovely room, comfy cotton batik robes, very comfortable bed. The grounds were amazing with fabulous gardens, great pool, esp for kids, stone structures. Very picturesque and relaxing. We relaxed with a cocktail by the water lilies looking out over the gardens with Mt Merapi in the distance. The food was delicious and the Javanese dancing/theatre was great. No complaints, would definitely stay here again."
"This was my second time to stayed in Hyatt. The last time was on March 2017. Stay 3 nights for bussiness trip at Hyatt Yogyakarta, i really enjoy my time there. Staffs were very friendly, and welcoming you since you arrived till you checked out. Overall hotel area feels calm, peacefull, and quite. Great pool area, good breakfast, and comfortable room. Requested room on high floor, which is less moist than room on lower floor. "
Very accommodating staff. They will try to satisfy all your needs. Very comfortable place. They even give me the room with the view of the volcano. Easy to communicate becaus almost all of them know how to speak english. ‚ò∫
"A great destination, just approx 2 hours away from Jakarta by flight. Part of Central Java and ruled by a Sultan who happens to also be the governor. Yogyakarta is a great destination for those looking for history and nature. People are really friendly and rich in culture.   Grand Hyatt - Regency   We have arrived beginning of April and stayed for 4 nights in this very elegant and nice hotel. The hotel is built with the Borobudur temple style and has great golf course, open lobby, very nice swimming pools, among other facilities.   Food is alright and good value for money. One meal will cost around IDR 100,000~ You can never go wrong with their Beef Burger. Restaurants are working up till 10:00 pm approx except for the bar / disco just behind the spa which is open until 1:00 am </span><span>&hellip;"
"Nice for people who wants to get calm, quite, and peaceful stay. Quite far and no public transport to downtown. No carpet so you need to use slippers all the time to avoid cold. Cool swimming pool spot for family. Nice decor and layout."
"I booked Hyatt in Yogja with a very good price through one hotel reservation website. Among others, I chose Hyatt to spend holidays with my family due to its quality credibility all around the world. The arrival was great as always in Indonesia (good service, welcome juice, fresh flowers welcome necklace), however the bedrooms are really old and smell moldy. We (2 bedrooms) changed rooms and the problem was the same. Unfortunately sleeping with this smell is not comfortable. In the other hand, breakfast was excellent. Dinner was average (still good comparing to local restaurants). The sports bar has an insane loud music to western ears. You cannot stay there for more than 30 minutes without getting annoyed. The sound system must be for a concert with 500 people, when there is</span><span>&hellip;"
We stayed two nights at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The added bonus for us being golfers was having the 9 hole course as part of the hotel complex.  The only downside was the the rooms where on tired side but nonetheless very comfortable.
"we love to stay here with our family, so many things to do with our kids, nice swimming pool, fishing pond, tennis court, golf and such a beautiful view around the hotel, the architecture of thr hotel is amazing! "
"Gorgeous hotel with immense grounds including running trails and putting greens, a huge pool going under bridges, around trails, including a waterslide, lovely restaurant with great food - the beef rendang was fantastic. Super experience, however became very crowded on the weekend (it was also a local holiday weekend) and the restaurant did not quite have enough space to keep up, meaning that the smoking/non-smoking sections in the outside sitting area got mixed which is not very nice when travelling with a toddler. Also the smoking/non-smoking sections are not physically separated so sitting on the border of the non-smoking section effectively means that the table next to you is smoking. The glass-elevator was a big hit with our son. The town shuttle runs only every two hours,</span><span>&hellip;"
"Hyatt Regency has done very well to maintain its reputation as one of the best hotel in Yogya. The location, facilities and staff were excellent. It was a great experience and will stay in Hyatt Regency again for sure!"
"My family enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt. The room was small and needed refurbishment and the AC needed repair but the staff were fabulous. The meals were good, the grounds amazing. Tennis courts and health club shabby. But the staff made up for it. Lovely stay. Would definitely return. "
"A nice hotel to unwind ad relax. Beautiful setting, Golf, pools, SPA but the rooms are small with old smell and outdated bathrooms. Tub with shower curtain is rusty. Mosquitoes because of tress and water on premises. You can walk to any eateries as it is a big property and takes you few minutes to just walk past the mail gate. Restaurant with Buffet breakfast is tasty and has large spread."
"Excellent service, food and rooms rated top of the line.  Money value is outstanding.  Local experience is rewarding to experience the culture and the food. Maybe a little more help on money exchange but still excellent service."
"We stayed for 3 months and had an amazing time. The grounds are spectacular, the building really beautiful and the staff, from groundsman to General Manager, went way above and beyond to make our stay terrific"
"Booked a club room for 3 nights whilst doing the usual tourist things and was wonderful to get back and relax after a day in the sun.  Pools are great, boxed breakfasts can be booked if you have an early start. Also a free shuttle to and from town is available. A few people warned us it was dated - its not super modern in style but is very well looked after and the staff helpful and friendly"
"relaxing, refreshing and soothing experience with pleasant atmosphere, welcoming staff, great service, tasty food, nice swimming pool and you have everything for a great holiday experience overall and i will definitely come back to this place soon...."
"excellent hospitality and staff.  breathtaking views from the room and beautiful property.  a perfect place to put your feet up, relax and enjoy a beautiful vacation.   can&#39;t tire of saying how wonderful the staff were. keep it up! "
"Staying with 5 people for 3 nights. The hotel has some nice aspects -- great staff, expansive tropical gardens and pool area, great breakfast -- but needs a major overhaul. Rooms are small and need an upgrade. Well below the standard I would expect from a 5 star hotel in Indonesia.   Also, takes at least 30-45 minutes to get into the major in city tourist areas. Recommend staying at any number of the in-town options (Phoenix, Dusun Jogja, Tenteng) or Hotel Borobodur if more rural experience is desired."
"I had stayed at this hotel for 1 night and that was too long.   The good:  I think the hotel has many wonderful features, the gardens are a gem, the water features, ponds, pools, lawns, gardens and many tropical plants are so beautiful and make you feel a million miles away from the busy Yogyakarta city area.   The staff were lovely. The food in the club lounge was pretty standard fare but the open bar spirits were nice. The flower arrangements in the hotel were gorgeous and a real nice touch. The design elements in the entrance with the water garden feel and Borobodur influences were fantastic.   The Bad:  Initially i booked a Club Hyatt room, i was given a King room on the ground floor with a nice outside area. My initial room had an awful mouldy smell, i actually couldn&#39;t</span><span>&hellip;"
"For the price, there is no better place to relax for a few days. Architecturally stunning in design of the building (modern twist to Borobudur) as well as the grounds/pools. We stayed 3 days but wish we could stay at least a week so we can enjoy all the amenities. I would definitely book again Hyatt Regency Jogyakarta."
"Stayed 10 nights and the staff absolutely great, friendly and very helpful. But the hotel itself is run down. 1 of our business team had to move rooms twice becuase of mould and musty smell, another had cockroaches in his room. I had no hot water for 3 days and then no tv for 2 days. Rooms very old. Food is terrible and not much variety. Food for buffet breakfast seems like left overs or food u would have for dinner eg pasta, roast chicken. Taste of food very bland. 1 of our business team wasn&#39;t well and wanted breakfast in her room, we were told cannot have breakfast in your room. We hired a car  it was 350 for 3hrs. We only used it for 1hr but still charged us 350. It needs terrible upgrade. Ill never stay here again. I pity the great staff as the hotel doesnt support their</span><span>&hellip;"
"Clean place and nice ambience. The staffs are polite and helpful. Simple activities like swimming in the pool, fishing and horse cart riding are great for young family. We got joint rooms for our family of 5. Rooms are smaller than newer hotels in the cities but everything else is almost perfect."
"One of Yogyas top hotels and we follow the Hyatt chain and it is very good, loved the opening lobby and design. Wonderful water games and pool and green luscious gardens with walking tracks and of course the famous golf course. The room was standard very good, with no issues, all that is needed and lked the decorations. We used the Business suite for eating and drinking and again of value; congratulations to the staff, the approriate snacks, the drinks and we loved the breakfasts. We were disappointed that we arranged an airport taxi to pick us up but it didn&#39;t arrive and the staff were apologetic and sought after the culprit."
it would be great to spend holiday at this hotel. the swimming pool is beatiful. The tranquility is perfect to escape.  But the room is small. The variation of breakfast is lovely but the taste is less than expectation. 
"Great location and amazing gardens,  beautifully lobby and quiet rooms. Cleansing of the rooms daily have room for improvement as well as the food serve for breakfast was normally cold. Staff could be more efficient but was very friendly and polite"
"Hotel is more than 20 years old.  You can see it in everything.  Rooms not updated, no clean sheets on the table.  A lot of holiday people with kids too.   I went here because I know the location.  Nice garden and golfcourse.   Prices not too bad I think, worth to go, but maybe there are better hotels now.  "
"There are so much activities to do within the hotel itself, especially for kids. Besides swimming and do water sliding, they can go fishing at the pond, they can visit birds park near the gym, horse ride around the hotel, etc."
"In the middle of rapid growing hotels industry, with strings of boutique hotels and big chains of luxury resort, hyatt still hasn&#39;t lost its charm. I was recently visiting Yogyakarta and stayed there for 5 nights. After 17 hours gruelling flight, I arrived at the premises. A staff welcomed me with fresh jasmine leis (heavenly scents!), helped with my luggage and ushered me into reception area. There were 2 large groups of guests who checked in at the same time. The staff acted very fast, efficient yet calm. I didn‚Äôt see any chaos nor panic measures happened behind the desk. Since my room wasn‚Äôt ready, a staff led me into the outdoor terrace where I waited and enjoyed a complimentary cold drinks - and indeed, acclimatised the weather. They even offered a short ride within the</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel is located in a quite area and surrounded by greenery. Good security is imposed by checking all visitors to the hotel at the gate before reaching the main building. There is a good choice of food for breakfast. The swimming pool is great allowing adults and children to enjoy. For those golf enthusiastics, the hotel offers a beautiful  9-hole golf course just next to the main building."
"It was a company outing. The welcome drink was refreshing. Room was okay. Didn&#39;t like the bathtub, wish Hyatt would change it coz current one didn&#39;t make one felt save to soak in it. Bed was okay. The one thing I felt satisfied with was the food and its variety. Not sure about the price since company paid for it."
"Hyatt is very comfortable, with a nice natural scenery. I was very impressed with good jogging track, golf course views. For those who bring children, here too, you can go around the hotel area with a horse cart. "
"I was visit at hyatt regency jogyakarta during  my business trip to jogyakarta. the hotel building look like borobudur temple, the room too small but I love surrounding hotel with beutiful green landscape also the pool very beautiful. and the service staff excellent"
"How do you review a hotel, which is ¬†perfect in all aspects - EXCEPT the room? The hotel is located among beautifully landscaped surroundings, the food is great, the service is good. The high expectations of all of these and the brand name came down crashing on seeing the room. It&#39;s SMALL. It&#39;s more like a transit hotel room, good for one days stay. There is not enough space for two people. The bathroom is also basic, with the state of the tiles calling for an urgent refurbishment. The toiletries are way, way below average for a hotel of this status.¬†  Other facilities like the gym, pool, restaurant, meeting rooms all are great. Absolutely no complaints about the service. The Wi-Fi is good.  Wish the room, which negates all the positives, could be updated to give customers a</span><span>&hellip;"
"In my trip with family I choose Hyatt to be our stay in Yogyakarta cause my uncle give recommend about this hotel. My son very enjoy with the pool, andong, bicycles , ground n garden at Hyatt regency."
Actually I visited this hotel very long time ago (years!). It&#39;s classy. The room is standard though. But what i love the most is the view. I did a morning yoga session with friends wgile enjoying morning sun and Mt.Merapi view. The sauna area is also nice. Such a memorable stay.
"I love everything about this hotel.  It&#39;s hospitality, golf course, swimming pool, food, flowers, architecture.  Definitely my go-to hotel in yogya. I saw the resto is being refurbished and wished the rooms are next to be refurbished.   I always want to come back.. "
"This is a nice Hotel, but what makes you feel real good is the way the Staff treated me and my guests. Very nice Lounge, good Pool Areas, small nice Gold Course. Nice entertainment in the evenings at Bogey&#39;s Bar"
"It is the second time I stayed here; the last time was 2012. The location and activities are wonderful, especially if you are a golfer. What is nicer than play 9 holes and having a beer on the terrace after seeing the Borobudur? (The course itself is nice with relative good greens)  The service in the hotel is great; all people are very forthcoming and it seems that they are happy to work here and make the guests feel at home. The breakfast and dinner possibilities are good although the wine selection is &#39;not cheap&#39; (as elsewhere in Indonesia).  We stayed here four nights and it seems that every evening the hotel organized something with live music. Not always with the best quality singers / musicians but who cares, it is entertaining.  What can use an upgrade are the rooms. We</span><span>&hellip;"
Hotel is big with complete facility...about 1/2 hour from the busy shopping market street of Jalan Malioboro. The garden is beautifully laid out and amenities are well kept. We used the hotel&#39;s shuttle to and fro Jalan Malioboro in the morning and spend the evening in hotel. Staff were helpful and friendly. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing stay. Our thanks to the staff team in Hyatt Yogyakarta....
"Always been my number one choice when staying in Yogyakarta. For me, everything about the hotel really brings out the city and all of its spirit and beauty. The staff was also always nice and friendly. When you came back after working all day, coming back to the hotel and have some nice and comfortable rest and relax really pays off..."
Yes this hotel is getting old but still a nice old 5 star hotel with luxury. Staff is very friendly &amp; the highlight for us has been the great choice of breakfast each day &amp; the vast variety of activities to choose from. The hotel is very friendly with kids as our Club lounge does welcome kids with special corners for families with kids. We will be back again &amp; hope to stay in their Suites next time.
"The hotel is a bit old in terms of decoration and furniture. But past that is a steal for what is charges! The breakfast is a feast, the bed is confy and there&#39;s even a gold course on the hotel premisses."
Stayed 2 nights for conference and met expectations. No issues with checked-in and room quickly assigned. Room located at 3rd floor but still well maintained. Fruit platter is a nice touch with comfortable King Koil bed and 43&quot; LCD TV.  The bathroom packed full with Hyatt amenities but the air con found to be a bit noisy. Polite staffs with true Yogyakarta hospitality - always smile and accommodating.  Tried their breakfast and not disappointing despite they could increase the variety of options given this is Hyatt standard. Location is not very close to downtown Yogyakarta so it&#39;s a good spot for unwind and chill in the hotel.
"I&#39;ve been to Grand Hyatt Yogyacarta about few times. Three years ago the hotel was not so clean especiallly the hallway to the room. Now everything looks cleaner except for the swimming pool that still needs to be cleaned up in my opinion.  The food at the executive lounge had moved to another part of the hotel instead of the small room that I enjoyed before. There seems to be a lot more food than before but the quality was the same. I wish there had been all kinds of cheese like the executive lounge in Holiday Inn in Bangkok instead of the usual finger food or Hor&#39;s d&#39;oeuvres. Still, the ambience was so great that I couldn&#39;t complain. The receptionist was so friendly and even had a drink with with me. This never happened to me before. Some PR personnel was very talkative.</span><span>&hellip;"
The staff really went out of their way to show care for our family. The food in the club room was nice and we enjoyed the setting and facilities as always. They stocked some diet cokes specifically for us and that personal touch meant a lot. 
"From the first check in until check out, me and my family was treat like royalty. We booked club room, so we have access to club lounge with tea, coffee and cookies all day long, and also evening cocktail from 5pm to 7pm with food and drink alcohol and non alcohol. It&#39;s so worth it. At the evening cocktail, the staff success to surprises me with birthday cake and candle.  Tommorow morning my daughter also got nice birthday present from the staff. We feel so special back then. I feel all the staff serve with heart. So genuine and friendly.  One thing that special is at 8pm the staff knock the door to ask if i needed anything like mineral water or towel and hand me bakpia (special cake from Jogja). My kids are so happy there, so many activies from them like ride Andong and</span><span>&hellip;"
"We have been there many times.. always happy with this resort... beautiful garden...  a very nice large garden...  a perfect place to stay in JOG area.. .around 15 minutes drive to down town of JOG.  A place to return to enjoy greenery... Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta.  Indeed it is a bit needed to touch up to refresh the product, it is well maintained, but it is good to have some refurbishment to be in line with some competitor.  FB service is excellent... as well as other department such front desk with is punctuality.. .commitment.. wake up call.. breakfast box :)... etc  Best wishes to Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, a place to return in the near future."
"I stayed for two nights and felt so welcoming in this hotel. The staff always smiling and greeting you. And they are willing to help if you do need anything. The moment you stepped out from the vehicle to the hotel, you are greeted with a humble wreath of jasmine flowers, a javanese welcome. As per any luxury hotel, they will be a specific someone attending to you and making sure you are seated comfortably in the reception area and are given lovely welcome drinks. We were brought to our humble room and my room was decorated with flowers all over. I could have gone into the flower bath, but I was too tired.  For those who have kids, so many swimming pools to enjoy. And so many activities in the hotel. Pillow fights (they will fall into the pool), fishing in the pond, table</span><span>&hellip;"
"One of the best hotel experiences, staff are so caring and responsive. Highly recommended for both family holidays, and romantic getaways.  Tours organized through the hotel were also first class. hotel is also conveniently located to major tourist attractions &lt; 40 minute drive for each."
The grounds of this hotel are very relaxing and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The pool is very large and offers many areas to rest without being with a lot of people.  The golf course which is attached to the hotel is a very nice course and not to difficult. I would recommend this location if you are in Yogyakarta.
"The hotel is fine. The staff are lovely. Always ready with a  greeting and very attentive. The Hyatt rewards system though is clearly lacking. I was not credited with points - apparently they thought I hadn&#39;t used Hyatt in the last 12 months - wrong! Dubai April 2016. Also (as I have experienced with Hyatt before, namely in Bali) the Fx rate at the desk is robbery. A 5% mark up on the money changers is an insult. So bring your own money."
"The price I have paid is around ¬£100 per night, the room one thee 7 floor with balcony, great view with Melapi, the hotel is beautiful and easy to go places, staff here are smiling and happy, highly recommended! Remember book top floor room with mountain view before coming"
"Awesome view of Merapi Volcano at your door step, and surrounded by its endless lush tropical garden...  fountains and waterfalls are the only noise that disturbs the tranquility of this paradise. Close to Saarah day spa with free pick-up and drop-off, courteous staff, good value for money, clean, plenty of space in our connecting rooms and wake up in the morning watching a family squirrel at play from our bedroom window."
"The hotel had been my family favorite in the past. It has great pool; lagoon like &amp; very instagramable.   This time I came back on business trip &amp; stayed on VIP Floor (level 5). The room&#39;s aircon was not cold &amp; the bathup was clogged. I had to call technician to fix those.  On the second night, there was gala dinner. The ambiance was excellent. It was like night of a thousand stars. What&#39;s not well was the taste of the food. From starters to dessert, the hotel failed to present a local cuisine with international tweak. The same situation during breakfast &amp; lunch. I hope the hotel pays more attention to this. "
"I had a three night stay at this hotel, and I must saw I was amazed.  From driving in to see the expansive and beautiful gardens, I was already blown away. I was then greeted at the car, luggage taken care of for me, door opened and was lead to the reception desk, where I was asked to sit and relax with a welcome drink whilst the staff took care of check in for me.  A big plus for this hotel is its staff, so well done guys!  Was given breakfast free of charge as well even though I knew I didn&#39;t pay for it, so that was a nice touch. Breakfast was delish as well, with a huge range of options which I loved, being a big breakfast eater myself. Pools were beautiful as well and always someone there to look after you.  The only only downside I have to say is the gym. The gym is very</span><span>&hellip;"
"Staff were very nice and bed was very comfortable. Always enjoy our stay here,  been staying here twice a year for the last 3 years. I would recommend to book the Club Room which includes club lounge access where they serve evening cocktail. Please try the massage they are good. If you are a golfer they have 9 holes golf course attached to the hotel. Its perfect for your short game. Look forward to come back here soon."
"We found the experience enchanting. The hotel is beautifully designed reminding you of the temples architecture with manicured grounds, including a golf course, a spa, a gym and a good business centre. The food was excellent and the staff very attentive."
"What could i say more, it was all perfect, specially if you bring your kids, they have enjoyable pool to cheers them up, an awesome views surrounding, Staffs are very warm welcome. One of interresting happen was when Staff (cleaning service) knocking our door offering additional towel and drinks that we can not found from the other hotels. "
"There are two basic thought I carry in my head when writing this review. The first is the class of the hotel. When I stay in a five stars hotel, the expectation is different compare to a budget hotel. The second is a kind of trend analysis. I stay in this hotel several times. Like it or not, it impacted my judgment.   Generally, I am experiencing a decreasing level of satisfaction. Their capability to provide a five star hotel service quality is deteriorating.   At a surface level, i.e. staffs friendliness, it remains un-change, but at substance level, there are a lot of deficiencies now happened.   Firstly, the smell of the property. With the exception of the lobby which smell good (lemongrass), it is not the case for many parts of the property, include the room. It smells like</span><span>&hellip;"
"I used to have high tolerance but the very disappointed experience staying ar Hyatt Yogya hotel have urged me to write this review.   We have stayed in numerous Hyatt and other 5-star hotels which always opt to give the highest excellence service level. I could not find any of those magnificent service at this hotel.  First we did not have smooth check in. Using on-line booking, we reserved 4 rooms for 3 nights. We arrived at the hotel on Thurs Jan 19 at about 3.30pm, and were told one of our rooms was not ready. When we came up to our 5th floor, we saw the designated room was actually ready. We called the receptionist to inform them, then we could get the room.  Second, very improper guest service combined with very bad extra-bed inventory. When checking in we asked for two</span><span>&hellip;"
This is the second time I write a review about this hotel and it is worst. The only improved thing was the flat screen tv. The other amenities stayed old and few were even deteriorating (see picture). Foods also stayed mediocre. After three years and very little improvement? That&#39;s sad.
"hyatt regency Yogyakarta have a beautiful lush garden to walk, nice swimming pool , beautiful golf course, it is suitable for family stay. Room is quiet old and need to be renovate. in general is still a nice charming hotel"
"The service is outstanding also the food it self, breakfast are confusing me because is alot..so which one should i choose first and all of them are great taste.just one thing they should improve, need renewal on the room decoration. Overall is very good"
"This hotel had everything for kids. My son was not bored at all. Fishing, golf, horse carriage, pool tables, water slide amd extensive pools. Had a gym, scenic area to walk and optional bikes for adults. A great 3 night stay. Thanks"
"This is a late review, however I still write since I still recall those great experience during my family visit 2nd week of December 2016. Upon checked in we were upgraded into a Suite room which was spacious enough, clean and comfy beds. Food quality during breakfast was good and fresh, we also tried room service which provide same good quality. Budi Sihing the Manager also very accommodating through our stay. We definitely will return."
"i was there for a meeting and it was great place,i was there for 2 nights i love the view and traditional exterior the room is old but it was comfortable room and clean everywhere i met the staffs they always put a smile on their face  it was my first experience stayed there and i fell in love with the green view as i enter the main gate of the hotel there were an out door tradisional wedding party in the garden and it was beautiful and the most important things are the food is good"
"Garden &amp; pools are the only things that are ok at this hotel. Everything else was HORRIBLE. Rusted, stain tubs and toilets. Furniture in the room is a mix match, outdated and in horrible condition. SPA was beyond dirty and smell like dead mice in there. Worse I have ever seen."
"Love staying in this hotel, the pool is big, my spa experience in here is excellent! Hotel have babysitting service which is great! My son loves it and the staff also very friendly. Breakfast menu is great with lots of variety. The pool is huge our family love it. We even spent new year in here and joined to their bogey rainforest event for new year. Everything is great the only downside is I am not sure if its because of the season we are there its rainy season our room is very damp, our bed seemed like we are sleeping in wet damp bed, we were on the ground floor. Then I requested to be moved to higher floor. However I feel sorry for other people if they stay in ground floor to replace us, its not very comfy in there in rainy season "
"Its very good location and facility to stay and enjoy of Hotel in Jogjakarta. Play Golf, walking good garden, so many kind of pool also very good view of Mt.Merapi. In citys very crowded and noisiy but here very quwiat and liluks."
"Stayed here for 3d2n. The hotel&#39;s very spacious and green and also has an amazing view to the volcano. Sized of rooms standard 5 star hotel, Breakfast with lots of variety and the taste is good.   The staff is very friendly and helpfull. The hotel has a spacious gardens and golf courses too.  I really enjoy stay at hyatt regency yogya and will be back üòâüëå"
"This hotel located outside the city of Yogyakarta. Beautiful landscape, very nice swimming pool! Our son love the slide! Nice interior but the room is little bit small. Breakfast was pretty good, a lot of variety food."
"I wouldn&#39;t really rate this place as a 5 star... the overall d√©cor/ambiance and fixtures/fittings are a bit dated.   Nevertheless, its quite a nice hotel and they have lovely and well maintained grounds and the pool area is really quite a delight! Breakfast is nice as well."
"We recently stayed at this hotel with my wife and 2 young boys.  The pool was a massive hit with the young boys particular the water slide.  The grounds of the hotel was very beautiful.  The wait staff at the restaurant were friendly and very attentive.    The hotel owner needs however to spend some serious money on the rooms and facilities as it is desperately needing modernising as the rooms and facilities are looking very dated.  To be fair the pictures depict this so they are honest in there presentation on the hotel, but I would say this hotel is more a 3 star hotel rather 5 star in modern standards.  The hotel check in process was confusing, we approached the desk and then told to sit on a couch to check in and then go through this check in process rigmarole/ceremony, all</span><span>&hellip;"
it was Superb experience staying at Hyatt Regency Yogya hotel. The view was amazing..overall view of hotel and golf very relaxing. I will definitely come back there.. The room was good. we love the swimming pool and all facilities in the hotel. guests need minimum 3 nights to spend in this Hotel.
"Overall hotel surrounding very beautiful, nice golf course  but it&#39;s a quite old hotel which require maintenance and upkeep.  Breakfast and Dinner buffet need more varieties. Bad experience with massage not worth the money we were paying.  "
"Great view, great bfast, exclusive Poor bedroom especially the floor and also poor bathroom need some renovations especially the shower, its water run too slow. Room is smaller than what we expected as a 5star hotel"
"It&#39;s a 5 stars hotel for its location, public facilities &amp; overall services - but not for my room&#39;s privacy, as it was very noisy from the floor above, people&#39;s slamming their door &amp; also noises from rooms beside mine....neither its F&amp;B service, as they need 1 hour for my simple dinner : soto ayam + sweet ice tea..."
"My family and I stayed for new year eve party at the Bogey. It was wonderful, the foods were various and never run out. This hotel is a perfect place for relaxing. Many choices of doing..from just sitting in the parks and pool...swimming..fitness..table tennis... biking..golf putting..jogging..walking around (this hotel has large area)..."
"Wow..where to start...golf course and pools are laced thru tropical gardens the lobby area is absolutely beautiful. the entry courtyard with the view of Marapi is astounding. The service is top notch, the food is amazing ( I had the best Christmas dinner i&#39;ve ever had.  The baked ham was World Class, the coffee is absolutely wonderful and the staff is first rate.  The rooms are first class.  I would return here just to stay here again.  I found it to be priced mid range because i booked it early thru agoda so for me it was an incredible bargain."
"The very first time for me to enjoy this hotel for a vacation, and it is great. The food, service and ambience it is very suitable for a vacation. Unfortunately wifi is not available for free. Recomended for every families who need vacation"
"It was my 3rd times staying at this hotel. If I come to Jogja with family, Hyatt Regency will always be my first choice.  What I like from this hotel are: very spacious garden, big pools with a long and fun slide, fishing pool for my kids and spacious room.  Breakfast is also great, with various options. Bread and pastries as well as traditional snacks are my favorites."
"The biggest characteristic of this hotel is a golf course in the sites. It is 1,904 meters of 9 halls par 30 short course. The golf course is well-kept and beautiful. Delicious meal, beautiful scenery, pool and golf course, this hotel is good resort."
"Serene, large landscape, beautiful garden, the serounding give me a sense of being in Yogyakarta, helpful staff nembers, room furniture / interior can be modernized. Visit these place often to spend a down time. "
"Am sure this hotel was great at one time but, for me, its typical of a locally run hotel now. In my opinion:  The good stuff  Staff very pleasant. Food OK. Well maintained grounds (but the majority of the land space is a golf course which is only for golfers).  The not good stuff  - was told by reception the pools are open 24 hours a day (except attendants and towels). At 05.30, on both mornings, the pools were full of flocculent - flocculent is a chemical that sits at the bottom of the pool overnight and attracts pool dirt to it (thus it cannot be disturbed). It is then vacuumed out of the pool along with the dirt in the morning (if they vacuum it all in time, which I don&#39;t think is always the case here) - flocculent should be used rarely to clean a pool and only when there is</span><span>&hellip;"
"It is a very posh and nice hotel, it has an amazing pool and other facilities, you can use a bicycle to go around the facility for free, and you can also join the bicycle tour of the rice fields and local villages. We stayed at level 7 and we specifically asked for a room with Merapi mountain view... and yes we got it. and it was amazing.  ps. you can also go and take a horse and carriage (or an Andong as locals would call it)... it was overall a fun and relaxing experience... plus again the staff are very friendly and welcoming."
"I was with my parents and two siblings staying at the Hyatt only for a short break during the long weekend. As my Dad is elderly, we got to borrow the available wheel-chair throughout our stay, and the hotel was ready with an oxygen tank when my Dad was having trouble breathing. The staff were so helpful and attentive helping us carry the wheelchair when we roamed the park near the pool. The view from our deluxe rooms were fantastic (the golf course, the park and the mountain in the far sight). I enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely be coming back here. The location is great too, not too far from the city center but far enough from the crowd. Many options of great restaurants are within vicinity of the hotel."
"Stayed with family in connecting Regency Club rooms . Nicely maintained rooms. Beautifully landscaped resort. Staff ( incl. trainees) at the Club lounge offer excellent service. Spcl praise to Bapak Budi, the rooms director."
"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for a work conference and was impressed by the beautiful setting and excellent services. The rooms are clean and comfortable, but the real asset of the Hyatt is the beautiful grounds that surround the hotel, the gorgeous pool that winds around the property, and the spa. It&#39;s an oasis in the city! Highly recommended for vacation or business!"
"For numbera of time we stayed in Hyatt, in fact in the last 4 years Hyatt is always the 1st preference when we visit jogja. Its very beautiful landscape and attention to details is excellent. But their strongest point is their staff. They always sincere and accomodating our needs especially to the kids."
"This is my favourite whenever I am in Yogyakarta. The minute you arrive at the hotel, you get an immediate sense of peace and relaxation, because the grounds are so lush with greenery and protected from the outside main road. The walk to the Reception is as though you are walking back in time through a historical palace, simple yet peaceful with the ponds and water flowing.  Many find the hotel old, but it fits with the character of historical Jogja, and the maintenance is quite good. The only problem is the hot/cold water that is inconsistent and also the poor water pressure for shower.  The facilities are very good, you have the choice from golf course to spa to multi-level swimming pools. The view at the restaurant dyring breakfast is so indescribable, must be experienced! </span><span>&hellip;"
"We were stay during the long weekend on December 10, 2016 until December 23, 2016  We book 3 rooms and reserve for early checking in at 10 AM, we were very thrill with the action and response from their Front office persons that make this early checking in was possible. We also love their kind arrangement of flower necklace and very refreshing welcome drink during our arrivals. Thank you for our angle during our checking in Ms. Fitry Natalia, and Mr. Yulianto from the front office and Mr. Jovi from the reservation office and the staff at the arrival Ms. Meylin, as she really helpful with our needs during our stay including our booking for the dinner at Ramayana Dinner as well. Again its very attention to detail, flawless and beyond our expectation.   From the breakfast side, we</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel is really showing its age.  Everything feels old or looks tarnished.  There was also a problem with ants (or small ant-like bugs) when we checked in.  The hotel had left out a plate of fruit for us, and had our flight not been delayed maybe there would be no issue.  Unfortunately, when we arrived at the hotel late at night, many little bugs had found the plate of food and were crawling all over the table.  After a little complaining the hotel moved us to a new room.  They also later left us some cookies and a written apology.  The next night, returning from a day long tour exploring nearby temples, the nightstand drawer was covered in the same little bugs.  House keeping had to keep coming up to our room spray for these bugs."
"Wonderful place, very well located,  with own 9 holes  golf club. Extremely friendly and efficient service and people. Very quiet. Close to new shopping mall, affordable prices, not exaggerated. Very much recommended. "
Woke up to music blasting outside of my room at 6:30 AM. I thought it was a concert but it was a morning fitness class. Not very considerate of other guest members! It literally lasted for a good couple hours. 
my guest room #223 and also friends rooms we noticed dampness. moisture on bed when the aircon was not turned on upon returning back to room.  my second day 3 am in the morning   i had problems accessing my room with the keycard and it took me x3 trips to sort it out. asked for wakeup call. no wakeup call was made.  x2 room service entered my room while i was asleep in the morning asking if i wanted fruit. i put up the privacy sign on the door. still room service entered again asking if needed fruit.
"Can&#39;t ask for more ... A beautiful hotel aiming at becoming the lungs of Yogyakarta. In the middle of nature but still in the city, its efficient and friendly service and peaceful environment gives you the highest value for a very competitive price."
"I don&#39;t mean to be harsh writing this review. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this IS a five star hotel, has huge area (includes a golf course), and in a great location... sort of, depends on your circumstances. For a couples&#39; getaway or just a getaway, it&#39;s is perfect. For others, you may want to check your itinerary distance against the hotel location. On with it, then. I was greeted with a flower necklace, Hawaiian style. Checking in was swift. I can see that it is a 90&#39;s luxury hotel. You may find some things are a bit outdated. The room amenities are as a five star hotel would be. Breakfast was plentiful with variety. Too bad, I didn&#39;t get to use most of the hotel facility, since I was here on business and had a tight itinerary schedule. All in all, I&#39;d recommend this hotel to couples</span><span>&hellip;"
"The check-in experience was horrible, we were asking for an extra bed so we expected s slight wait so they could finish setting up the rooms. We ended up waiting for more than an hour! and there are not even apology from the reception girl. I went to see the room and it was still filthy with no sign of anyone actually started the cleaning up process! Went back down and to ask my money back, we were quite ready to get out of there, but somehow we managed to get another room within 10 mins. Aside from the horrendous check in experience, the hotel was quite old and some of the common areas was dirty. One of our rooms also reeks of cigarette smells.   On a more positive note:  The hotel ground is beautiful and it has good ammenities"
"Hotel with lovely facilities, the swimming pool and its surroundings are fantastic, you are greeted with a jasmine flower necklace and from that moment you start to transport yourself in the charm of the hotel.  Comfortable rooms, old bathrooms that could be refurbished.  Restaurant and food unremarkable.  The massages in the pool area a delight"
"Relax time with friends, other than biking or golf.. nice swimming pool... and can have jacuzzi time at the sport lounge.... the food was nice... friendly staff... the down side the wall a bit thin so can&#39;t really talk loudly "
"This is a wonderful hotel. Magnificent sprawling grounds, delightful staff, the right mix of Javanese culture and  style with all the mod cons - all blending to produce subdued and comfortable luxury, and with plenty of pleasing details for the senses. Unlike so many other luxury properties the luxury here is not ostentatious, it feels just right. Highly recommended."
"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. This property is huge!  Very relaxing hotel, you do not really see a lot of other guests.  The buffet was good.  A lot of activities in the hotel, including a gold course.  The building is a bit old though.  The staff was super nice and very accomodating"
"Probably one of the most beautiful hotel grounds I&#39;ve ever seen. Right from the stunning  entrance and the view of the landscape to the beautiful vast greenery all around the hotel, for the entire 4 day stay there we kept finding hidden treasures. The water slide, the fishing pond, the coy pond outside for cocktails and the coconut trees are all so lovely plus of course the golf course. Also the staff were so well meaning that it makes my next comments hard to say. The service was terrible, management so out of touch with the realities of what&#39;s happening, house keeping not upto scratch and the restaurant staff though lovely people not trained properly.  It made each dining experience frustrating unfortunately.  Also, major warning, do not go to the spa, it&#39;s dirty, the staff</span><span>&hellip;"
I know it&#39;s super cheap but I am even scared to think how old is the hotel! It&#39;s in serious need of renovation!! And the spa is almost creepy.... like a public bath in some Easter European country. But the territory is beautiful. And it&#39;s super cheap.?
Had a lovely time staying at Hyatt..Place is huge..awesome pool for the kids to play. Good selection of buffet breakfast with local and international cuisine. Free shuttle to the city..love the staff working there ever so friendly
calm and nice hotel. good for golfing. good view. relaxing. helpful staff. i would love to come again and again.  would be good if adding batik and souvenir shop inside the hotel and upgrade the room furniture
"We stayed here with 2 small children for 4 nights in October. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, but the rooms are very small and outdated. We expected a bit more when we arrived at the hotel, cleanliness is a problem and the room smelt like mould. Other guests also complained about the same thing.   We also tried the Spa at the hotel and unfortunately it was a huge disappointment.   The breakfast was ok and the hotel catered more for local people than for westerners.   On the positive side, there are many activities for kids (fishing in one of the ponds), beautiful swimming pools and water slides.   I would recommend this hotel to families but upon check in I would ask the hotel staff to see the room first as the mould might be a problem for people with asthma.   "
"This hotel is looking a bit worn, although the service is good and the staff is very friendly. Food was average, nothing special. Regular rooms appear uninspiring but Club room was quite nice. Overall, the hotel needs to be spruced up. It has the feeling of a colonial era tropical resort."
"If you want to escape the hustle &amp; bustle of Yogyakarta, stay at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. It&#39;s the most beautiful Resort Hotel in Yooyakarta with beautiful manicured garden, salt water pool and Golf Course. You can spend the morning just walking/ jog around the hotel (they have special jogging track inside the hotel) or dip into the salt water pool. The hotel is beautiful. And the garden is definitely the most beautiful hotel garden in Yogyakarta. It&#39;s such a pity that over the years, the management has done nothing much to maintain or upgrade the rooms which by now is so....dated. Yes it clean but it&#39;s so old....and the room is too dark. I think it&#39;s about time to upgrade the rooms.  The other aspect to pay attention to is the quality of food. It&#39;s been degrading over the</span><span>&hellip;"
"Everything are just find, but the guest room need to be refurbish. Facilty are great and staff are very friendly. The room facilty and amenities are completely provided. The location perhaps a bit far from city center, but overall it&#39;s just great."
"Hotel is old but fairly clean. Room and bathroom was spacious - we had a room with balcony. As this is more like a resort, carpark was outdoor. Breakfast has good variety but taste was soso. Service provided was good. Location of hotel was about 15-20mins drive from the famous Malioboro (do try kopi joss, gudeg, and nasi kucing when in jogja)."
"Yogyakarta is just a hop away from Jakarta, the minute you step foot on the soil you will truly feel how relaxing this city is. However, the Hyatt Regency offers more than just a relaxing trip to Yogyakarta, it offers you tranquility. The hospitality, the view of the Merapi, the hotel green pasture, the huge swimming pool with the water slide and other fun water activities, the spa, the wonderful buffet menu. The areas around the golf course also gives the opportunity for selfie addicts to take a stroll and start taking selfies. You can also try the horse chariot provided by the Hotel to experience &quot;andong&quot; as the traditional transportation to kampong. Put on your sneakers, take a walk outside the hotel area, then you will find coffee houses within walking distance."
"One word to describe our stay, &quot;Perfect.&quot; Our stay here was a wonderful experience.  Well maintained, luxury hotel with golf courses! As you walk in, you are transferred into paradise. Jasmine lei welcome greeting from the staff makes you feel so special. Beautiful entryway away from the rough edge city center. There is free shuttle to and Marliobo Street where there are local restaurants and clothes shopping. In addition to that, free horse carriage ride to nearby town to view rice patties. Breakfast buffet was absolute wonderful with many many food stations that will whet your appetite.  There are several pools so they are children friendly here. Do not bother to stay anywhere else."
"The staff are EXCEPTIONAL here. Especially at Kemangi restaurant - they were wonderful people.  They spoke excellent English, not that it should be a requirement, but it was nice to have conversations, as we are not fluent in Indonesian languages (yet).   We however had 3 people in our group which was difficult to fit into 1 room. They gave us 2 twin beds. Choice was that or 1 king. The 1st floor (ground level) smelled like sewage for the 5 days we were there. The air conditioning didn&#39;t operate in the room unless the lights were on. It was uncomfortably hot without the AC, so we slept with the light on. I might expect accommodation like that at an economy price, but the price we paid was among the highest of the standard options in Yogyakarta.   The resort layout is very nice.</span><span>&hellip;"
"My friends and I visited Yogyakarta as part of a two-week trip around Indonesia and our experience at this hotel was the best of our entire trip. The staff were so friendly, helpful, genuine, and smiling all the time. They even organized a special surprise for my friend&#39;s birthday and gave me a bouquet of flowers to congratulate me on my recent PhD completion. We felt like we were being treated like royalty. The hotel itself is beautiful and the grounds are stunning, with a wonderful view of Mt Merapi (when it&#39;s not cloudy). The rooms were clean and had a lovely view of the grounds, a lush, tropical paradise. I would definitely stay here again. Also a great value for money!"
This is my secaon time to stya over in this hotel.  Great staff and nice hotel to stay for vacation.  I&#39;m willing to extend my stay but too bad it was fullly book and have no room at all.  It can tell that so many people love this Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta very much.  For sure if go to Yogyakarta will stay in this hotel again.
"The Hyatt is a really wonderful hotel. And it most definitely has the best views of Merapi in Jogja. But they really need to get some proper ventilation in the hotel especially in the rooms.   I have a mild mould allergy, and each time I walked through the hallway I began sneezing. I initially thought I was getting a cold.   The rooms are quite humid (we were offered a humidifier thankfully, and the cleaning staff opened our windows but said that they don&#39;t as a general rule due to safety concerns - no safety mechanisms for a windows five stories up).   I&#39;m not sure how the mould issue can be rectified as it would have built up over several wet seasons - something that is of course very normal in the tropics. But for the price of the Hyatt, you think they would have attempted to</span><span>&hellip;"
"This is an excellent resort, it has beautiful grounds with a very nice golf course. We were able to see the volcano on a clear day.  The staff is super as they went above and beyond in a situation for my daughter.great food esp. The breakfast buffet, very ,very reasonable."
"This hotel is special. They have nice park with temple surrounding. I guess golf arena too. You feel refresh n tranquil just sit n enjoy the greenery around.   The pool is nice. Have several parts for children and adults. May play sliding to the water from above. It is fun.  The noted is room. Quite small compare to the same class. Interior need to renew.   Breakfast is nice. Almost everything they have. Taste is delicious. From traditional to modern meals served.   If you are looking for resort, then this will be good experience staying here. "
"This hotel offers an oasis environment for business and leisure travelers alike, but rooms should be upgraded.   Guests are greeted warmly upon arrival with warm smiles, a fragrant jasmine lay, and a cool tropical drink.   The front desk staff is friendly and efficient, and politely offer suggestions for hotel services that make your stay most comfortable. A shuttle bus is available for nearby shopping trips.   The grounds are the most impressive part of this hotel. Landscaping is lush, the koi ponds are pleasantly distracting, and the pool areas are superb. Golf, spa services, tennis and other recreational activities are offered.   Dining options at the hotel are few, but food is tasty and buffet options are numerous.   Lastly, the rooms are satisfactory but should be</span><span>&hellip;"
"Front office until back office very friendly person. The hotel clean n comfort except the pool, the water looks dirty and not fresh maybe the rain caused that. But anything &quot;perfect&quot; 4 thumbs for this hotel, will back someday  :)"
"Very beautiful hotel with great garden, golf and swimming pools. Good break while visiting the beautiful temples in YogJa. Small golf course is an additional extra, however you need to stay longer to enjoy it. Not really far away from the attractions and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpfull."
"From the welcome jasmine garland, juice, cold towel and shoulder massage - all before check-in is complete -  to the last farewell, this place is outstanding. Rooms are quiet and spacious. We had a balcony room which was pleasant for that early morning cup of tea watching the beautiful garden grounds come to life.   The breakfasts are not to be missed. Think of a food, and it is on the breakfast buffet. The dining room serves food all day which is lovely if you are out and about and wish flexibility as to when you eat. Reasonably priced food though alcohol is extremely expensive.   Beautiful pool area and grounds. Good spa facilities with easily available appointments. Sad we were only here two nights!"
"Nice room, nice staff. Check in experience was great. Plenty of hotel activities. Hotel bit far from the city center. Would recommend this hotel to a friend with family who want to visit yogyakarta..."
"We love this hotel. This is the second time we have stayed here. It&#39;s an oasis amid the hustle and bustle of a Javan city. The large property, with the golf course and the pool slide that has architecture inspired by Borobudur, oozes serenity. You hardly ever want to leave, even thuogh the city has great attractions."
"We were in Yogyakarta for two days and we stayed at the Hyatt for two nights. The property is stunning with its golf course, its green and beautiful and there is something very homely and rustic about it. It definitely is not a modern hotel, it is on the older side but that was something we loved about it. The staff was wonderful and the pools are great. We felt very comfortable and relaxed and the spa was great as well.We took on the recommendations of one of the posts below and went with the driver suggested and I have to say thank you, he was just brilliant and the kindest man we&#39;ve ever met so if you&#39;re ever in Yogyakarta do call him : +62 812 17741209 (Imam). All in all a wonderful stay at the Hyatt and it&#39;s definitely my go to hotel in Yogyakarta. "
First stay in this Hotel at 2002 and always love this Hotel until now especially when in Family vacation. This Hotel is the best for family vacation. They have a best view from the room. Big swimming pool. They have a fishing pool also. Nothing complain about this Hotel.  They have their own golf field. They have a very delicious ginger candy at the reception desk. We will be back and stay in this Hotel again if we will go to Yogjakarta. 
"We were on a holiday trip for 2 nights .Over all stay was very good .Check in staff was really nice . Nice rooms and beautiful ,serene surroundings !! Would love to stay more during next visit !! Food needs variety ."
"I want to comment on the Spa not the hotel. The hotel looks beautiful especially the pool.  As for the Spa - prices are really reasonable but service was not that of a 5* hotel. Few things that weren&#39;t great:  &gt; the room was freezing. I had to ask three times for her to turn off but she kept turning the aircon down just one degree or two. I was literally shaking before she turned off about half way through &gt; she never left the room. Not when I showered or got into the bath. She stood by the door using the sink while I showered. She didn&#39;t hold up a towel either when turning or moving. Any masseuse I have ever used has done that - seems pretty basic for making people feel comfortable  &gt;massage was okay but she only focussed 1/4 of the time on the back, and most time on the legs</span><span>&hellip;"
"Very kind staff (special thanks to Catering Manager and the staff at the restaurant)  Garden is wonderful for memorable pictures.  swimming pool and water slide are perfect for kids. Kids can also fish in the pond, see the birds and play golf.  However, the Kids Club is not at the level of a five stars hotel: - Kids Club is more like a 2x3m dark room for storage - Personnel are out of control after 2 kids registered - No special activities proposed even if the hotel has a potential itself  Recommendations for the hotel: - Hire young local women (not men) and train them to Nursery and kids caring program Provide English teaching lessons to them as well - &quot;Kids eat for free&quot;, &quot;Free juice refill&quot;, &quot;Free ice-cream&quot; and welcome kids gift (water bottle, Hyatt Cap) with a kids program</span><span>&hellip;"
"Checking is perfect. Staff make you feel comfortable with a welcome cocktail. The hotel facilities are very good, specially the swimming pool that is perfect for kids (and adults also). The rooms are big but the bathrooms need a renovation. The food at the restaurant is really good: perfect cooked, well presented, large portions,..."
"Beautiful hotel where you are made to feel welcome from the first moment on with offers of a shoulder massage, delicious juice and courtous service. The food is very good. The pool is beautiful and transform the landscape. "
I recently stayed at the Hayatt in Jogjakarta on business. The hotel was great even before I got to the country. They organised a car to pick me up with details of how I would be met. On arrival I was presented with a jasmine lei and seated and given a cool drink while I was checked in.  The rooms were generous.  The hotel is situated in the grounds of a golf course. It has a magnificent pool and a small gym. The terrace bar is a great place to get a drink and watch the golfers go by. While there I had an issue with the plumbing. A call to reception had maintenance there in minutes followed by housekeeping. The service was excellent. The meals were good and eating out at the pool was a great way to start the day.
"Ambience and View were the only selling point for over 1mio from rate at this stage. It will be a high appreciation to the existence and guest of Hyatt Yogya can upgrade the service, in-room furnish, ballroom and meeting are (priority), and manager level manner. Please Read detail in feedback."
"A stunning setting and wonderful staff. I arrived with a terrible sickness bug, and the staff were absolutely fantastic - I couldn&#39;t have been better looked after anywhere. Ana, in the restaurant organised a ginger drink to be taken to my room on both days, and the manager sent anti sickness medication. The hotel was in a very beautiful setting and the restaurants, buffets etc were absolutely exceptional : the chef asked if he could do anything to make my stay better:: the answer was a resounding NO , everything was perfect! I shan&#39;t be in this neck of the woods for a while, but I would fly out of Jakarta every weekend for this luxury. Thank you so much everyone ..."
"This hotel so clean and comfortable room,staff all friendly and helping also good taste for food. Enjoy to stay and if wants to see around the view is so good for good view in all hotel location. Have green garden so beautiful."
"The Hyatt Yogyakarta has been an annual visit for us over many years and it continues to provide a great experience.  The faculty has a traditional feel but is always immaculate and well maintained. Food and beverage is very good and the staff is professional and always friendly. The pool is resort-like; a must try. Although it&#39;s on the outskirts, that&#39;s not a bad thing in Yogyakarta, and they even have a gratis shuttle to and from the shopping district.  We always look forward to returning. "
"There is a lot of mediocrity in Yogyakarta, but this property is above that.  The grounds, the gold, the pool are the big draws for resident expats and tourists alike. This is a marvelous setting in which to build a hotel. The hotel market in Yogyakarta has been flooded with new construction, so process are falling and the Hyatt is no exception. Prices are very competitive. Service is good, and the amenities are solid. The rooms are starting to show their age around the edges, but I would still prefer to be in this hotel than any other in Yogyakarta."
"Outstanding hotel! Not cheap but very pleasant. Very well trained staff and good food. The location is a little bit out of center of the city, but it also helps to avoid the traffic if you planning to travel around. Great times!"
I stayed for 2 night in Hyatt Regency with my family. All staffs were very nice and helpful. My daughter very exited with their pool. They has great and beautiful pool that entertaining kids and adult with the view and design. The food was great quality and completed. I will stay in this hotel every time I goes to Yogyakarta. Keep great work Hyatt Yogyakarta 
"Wife and I stayed here in Nov 2015.  Soon after checking in, I opened the balcony and saw a MASSIVE column of smoke rising with some flame a few feet from our room I didn&#39;t believe it was a fire as there were no alarms or any shouts/activity (thought it may be some dengue fumigation), but my wife freaked out We tried calling front desk, no answer 3-4 times  Then they finally picked up and said yes there&#39;s a fire, please come down! Again, no alarms 10 minutes into our seeing this big fire!! We evacuate and when we reach the lobby,  the whole place was full of smoke. THEN the alarm goes off!  The whole hotel was evacuated. No loss of life luckily, and source of fire was kitchen oven  All guests congregated in outdoor restaurant. Parents were furious as their kids were sleeping in</span><span>&hellip;"
"You know you picked the right hotel when you step out from car and the staffs spontaneously carry and track where your room is without you saying anything. This is my second time staying in Hyatt, the landscape and swimming pool always cheers me up, very relaxing. I think this is the only hotel offering a resort theme in Yogyakarta. Breakfast was good, staffs are great and very helpful. "
"Hyatt is a very beautiful place for stay.  The room is very old but well taken care. Very neat, clean, tidy. When I got there, they give white flower necklace. The hotelier is very friendly.  Scenery is very good.  With the golf park and big ponds.   Big swimming pool with different size of height.  There is a slide there for kids.   You can fish and ride a bike.   Playing golf.  Massage  Spa and sauna.   Breakfast is nice too.  Try the egg lava. Very nice.   Thanks Hyatt for your hospitality. I am going to visit this hotel again. "
"What a lovely place to go anytime you&#39;re in jogja..this is exactly the best place for you to enjoy the quiet nature,best hospitality with fair prices..i can say that they have everything to make you feel comfortable when you stay..and also you can get bonus of your stay to get free stay on the next visit..i already collect 2 nights stay without bfast and 1 night stay with bfast..fair enough,huh? üòä"
"I always stay here for business trip. An exotic place. Even better if I stayed here with family. The room is spacious enough. The breakfast is delicious with many choices. I will definitely come back here, hopefully with my family."
"Hyatt still the best, keep it. I love this part, u make my adventure perfect into the maximum. When u arrive the hotel. U could feel as part of the movie like lord of the rings, tombs rider etc, ur imagination flight into higher degree."
"Excellence services for a great experience. Great breakfast, lunch and dinner. Wonderful staff. The environment was great with superb view. Really clean.  I will definitely return to enjoy another stay."
Super nice staff and great food for a hotel restaurant. The hotel is quite old but the staff  made up for it. We stayed there for two nights and totally loved the experience. The room service was awesome too. Miss the place already. Thank You Putra for accommodating our request for early check-in.
"This is a wonderful place to end up after 30 hours of air travel to get here from states.   The grounds are beautiful.  Garden with tropical feel, number of pools.     Check in smooth.  Welcome drink.   Rooms are fair size.  Could be sound proofed more.  Nice view to plush landscape outside.  Food is excellent.  Spa treatment cheap and good.  Bedding wonderful."
Spent a great 4 nights at this hotel and I can&#39;t wait to go back. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. The gardens are absolutely stunning. The food is delicious.  There are lots of activities including a Spa. Wonderful hotel. 
"Air Yogya very unfriendly to traverse by plane causes a feeling of uncertainty. Furthermore, following a full day symposium causes the body is very tired. All the anxiety and fatigue disappear once greeted and given a smile by the staff of Hyatt Regency hotel, lying on the bed were clean and comfortable rooms as well as a beautiful view."
"Staff is very friendly always ready to help you. Pools are big and with clean water. Hotel restaurante serves very good food for even better price. Lots of varieties of plants, 9 hole golf course. Breakfast has everything you can expect, great fresh juices."
"We stayed there for the first couple of days of a tour round Java. Perfect location for seeing the sights. Breakfasts huge and great. We ate dinner on night and we were really impressed with the food, we moved up to the Bogeys bar for drinks and really enjoyed the vibe in the evening. The pool is huge, we used the gym which was fit for purpose. We popped round the corner to dinner on the second evening to a restaurant the hotel recommended and had some great food. "
"The Hotel is quite old but it is well placed and a very good environment (landscape), one that is surrounded by nice big extended pool and golf course. It is my first time to visit Jogja. The hotel&#39;s location is perfect, quite environment for relaxation and family outing. The entrance is enlightening and the staff are very friendly. Moreover, Jogja is a famous tourist hot-sport in Indonesia and the traffic is not bad at all, shopping at Malioboro is exciting as well.   Great hotel and perfect place for holidays (Hyatt Regency, Yogyakarta).  Pomat"
Terrific staff and incredible pool and gardens. I highly recommend this property if you are staying in this city for any reason. The gardens and grounds are a sight to behold.  The golf course is also excellent. 
"Beautiful hotel, very friendly staff , has a mini golf course for golf lovers. Nicely landscaped with a serene setting. The free shuttle to Malioboro mall/ shopping area is a good facility offered by the hotel. The entrance from the road to the lobby requires better lighting, for those who would like to take a walk out in the night. Restaurants, a bakery and pharmacies available just outside the hotel. Great place !"
"Can&#39;t fault the staff for friendliness and service.  We were unlucky to be next to the bridal suite so were woken before 6am by people preparing for the wedding (staff that is).  The only other downside was the spa which is in great need of a tidy-up and clean as it was really quite dirty and all parts of it needed repair.  It&#39;s a nice hotel though and the staff are what makes a place.  Nice grounds for the golf, and the band insists on taking requests from guests!"
Plus point Good landscape with garden and pools Cool sliding to the pool Good breakfast Nice free andong ride Friendly welcome greeting Location easy access  Minus point Old room also you can&#39;t open the window 
"Since this Yogyakarta is tourist destination, the review is based that we are checking in on Sunday for our stay over here. It wasn&#39;t a peak season during our course of stay over here in this hotel.  Hotel reception was friendly and helpful when checking in. She is helping and making sure that the room is ready for us, since we arrived a little earlier than the normal checking in time. Once we checked in and requested to change another room, it was quick and helpful without much hassle. We changed to room opposite, side by side with another room. However, though it&#39;s joint room, but we didn&#39;t really bother as we either enjoying the hotel facilities or outside for sightseeing.  The room view was nice, facing the spacious garden. We definitely enjoying the greenery view over here.</span><span>&hellip;"
"Very recommended for ur activity business or holiday...for the breakfast no dimsum, but combinations western n Indonesian food so good, the view it&#39;s great, love to visit again...for the swimming pool great view but more chlorine "
"Had a wonderful stay here with my toddler. Magnificent landscape with huge pool. We enjoyed the free andong ride, took a short stroll by bike and fed the fish in pond.  Room was a bit outdated but clean and well maintained.  Wide variety on breakfast buffet though mostly tasted bland. "
"I stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days.  The experience was good, almost excellent tho..  The moment you arrived, you are refreshed by the setting of the hotel, the theme and the greens, the gardens are just amazing! Then you go in and greeted by a warm staff helping you to check in. Untill here the experience was still very pleasant.  It changes when Im in the room, its quite a let down I would say. The Style its quite old and outdated. The only nice thing is because we have a balcony.  The balcony itself is overlooking the beautiful pool with a garden setting, also the golf course.  The breakfast was very good also as it serve quite a lot of authentic Indonesian food. If u are adventurous about food, this is the best choice!  Overall the staffs was very warm and friendly, the</span><span>&hellip;"
Complacency has set in. It is time to rejuvenate both physical and soft sides of hotel - before it is too late. Check in was slow. So was check out. Room is very rundown. Service at the lounge was superficial. On the positives - location and space are excellent.
"Stayed in Hyatt 2 times on a business trip. The room is spacious and nice. I love the view from the hotel lobby, it&#39;s very rare that we can enjoy our time at the hotel lobby. I might visit this hotel again on my next trip to Jogjakarta"
"Hyatt Regency with better view, golf field beside and larger open room.  Hyatt regency had to type of breakfast/dinning  room, indoor and outdoor with swimming pool view.  I was enjoying to stay at this hotel, and the staff are very open for every concern, and their response are faster to accommodate or revalidation any guest concern."
Hyatt Yogya landscape is perfect. From the moment you walk up to the lobby you&#39;re swept of your feet. Rooms are spacieus. Food is great. Love the POOL! Walking by the Spa you are on the first tee for a nice 9 hole golf play.
"Stayed at the Hyatt while teaching at the the university. The hotel is not new however being set next to a golf course the setting is wonderful,  trees and greenery everywhere. The hotel staff are totally professional and extremely nice. Highly recommended if you want a totally relaxing venue"
"It has been a fantastic trip, Overall, It&#39;s a pretty good and relaxing. Staycation with a relaxing view. Very good for family vacation. Breakfast menu needs variation. Nice staycation and nice experience."
"This is the second occasion to stay here, and on this our return, we were not disappointed. This resort hotel has absolutely beautiful grounds in which to walk and just enjoy the peace and quiet. There is also a nine hole golf course for those who are so inclined, but the swimming areas are for me, the best. The standard double room was adequate and clean and the bed very comfortable. The food was wonderful with such a large election for breakfast, including my favourite - Bubur ketan hitam with coconut milk, enak sekali!! We ate every night in the restaurant and once again the food was of the highest standard. This is the hotel to stay at when in Yogyakarta, with friendly helpful staff, what more can you want?"
"Hyatt Yogya is my favorite hotel because of the quiet location but it offers much physical exercise: jogging, golf, or just strolling around the greenery. Too bad the discount for green fee is so minimum that I refrain from a 9 hole! Would propose guest discount for green should be to 50% to make the course even busier and many golfers would stay there!"
"Nice one, u can relax your mind in here. But they need to upgrading their floor into wood panels or add carpets on the floor The breakfast has various menus from western, asian, and indonesian but the taste is so so for 5 stars hotel"
"Well designed, great architecture, many facilities are also available. Love the evening cocktail, although it&#39;s only 2 hours (probably just increase one more hour). It&#39;s not just a building i like the most, but the outstanding scenery. Will reconsider coming back this hotel in the coming future."
"From pick up at the airport to checkout, we were well taken care of. Upon arrival, we were greeted with welcome drinks while they prepared our check-in. Very friendly.  We stayed at room 435. Although not facing the front of the golf or pool view, the view was pleasant - can see the garden and part of the golf course.   Our room was very clean and was tidied up everyday and fresh towels and mineral waters replaced. Perhaps it does seem a little worn down as it is not a new hotel but still very clean and comfortable.  Buffet was good, a pleasant mix of local and western food. And the buffet price is very reasonable..  We truly enjoyed the Ramayana Ballet show and Saturday night buffet. Even little girl enjoyed it. Other nights - restaurants are within walking distance but mostly</span><span>&hellip;"
We stayed at this hotel because we know what typical Hyatt Regency&#39;s are like. This hotel did not live up to expectations. The rooms were not clean and the bathrooms were even worse. There was soap scum all over the showers and mold in the sink. The food and beverage choices were not up to par either. We will not be coming back to sleep his hotel. There needs to be some serious money invested to upgrade and modernize the hotel. 
"I prefer to stay at Hyatt because this hotel has a nice lawn and landscape, plus huge swimming pool. Breakfast was great with many selections but need to improve more on menu. Room is rather small but well equipped with amenities and yes it is very clean. The hotel provide free shuttle bus to malioboro and free horse cart ride, nice for family."
"Hotel staff are very unskilled and keep cause trouble to hotel guest. The laundryman put 2 holes on my T-shirt, The receptionist hang up my phone. The front desk staff forget to give my passport back after check in. And the hotel management team seems not care any of those issue.  Hotel room facility condition is also very bad, Sofa is broken, a big hole in the bottom. The thermostat in bedroom is broken. There are many conspicuous scratch on toilet seatconspicuous scratch on toilet seat.  Hotel room is also very dirty, there are bloodstains on the sofa, and hair on bed, and  dust everywhere.  This hotel do not have Guest Service Directory, so the hotel staff can make excuse for any basic things been defined in every Guest Service Directory in almost every star-hotel.  This</span><span>&hellip;"
We had a nice relaxing stay at Hyatt. Very nice hotel and friendly staff - good food. Maybe standard rooms could be improved - no bathtub please (danger for people with reduced mobility) better shower cabins.  Great swimming pool and gardens.  Perfect spa and massage. we will be back in November 30 th 2016 with a big group - 30 rooms
"Really like the quiet and peaceful environment of the hotel and the facilities of the hotel. Really nice scenery at the pool and having meals by the pool side makes me feel real calm.   Staff are extremely courteous, helpful and friendly, I had a few dramas, checking in late in the night at the hotel, having dinner at almost wee hours, had some problems (probably my mistake) with the flushing system of the toilet, but I have never felt any unhappiness from the staff throughout my stay"
"We stayed as a family of 4 and had a nice time at the Hyatt. The room was basic for a mid to high end hotel. Clean but had small ants that were attracted to some of our open food supplies.   Outside the rooms there were plenty of family activities to keep a 2-year old busy including simple fishing, a very good hotel pool slide, horse and carriage ride and putting on the attached golf club&#39;s practice green.   Service was good if not amateur at times. Food was decent but overpriced. The hotel is 30 minutes away from the main tourist part of Yogyakarta. We enjoyed our stay, well recommended."
"stayed here for 4 nights in August and I would say this hotel is worth every single cent.   location - it is far from Yogya city centre. approximately 20 - 30 mins car ride depending on the traffic. but it is really peaceful and has everything you need in the compound.  compound - really huge hotel with many pools (even a silent pool which we hang out there every single night after dinner), golf course, bars, restaurants, spa etc. they have lots of activities within the hotel too.  restaurants - we had all our breakfast and dinner in the hotel. love how they have different themes every night. We tried their BBQ night and it was really good. their ala carte are not that worth it. we went for their buffet instead. breakfast was a good spread. try their local wines!  room - room</span><span>&hellip;"
We had three nights here resting and relaxing in between trips. The grounds are extensive and include lovely walk ways around the golf course and an incredible and gorgeous set of swimming pools. The room and service was excellent and the breakfast in particular deserves a mention for its extraordinary array of delicious offerings. Recommended.
"Very nice hotel, the green, the nature.. Hotel is clean, very nice staff and nice service. Yummy food, lots of choices. They have a bit of everything for everybody.. We enjoyed the fishing at the little pond they provided. My son loved it a lot.. and also the pool is nice too."
"My partner and I decided on a bit of 5 start luxury for our short 4 day stay in her home town of Yogyakarta. Whilst not the newest of places, age brings charm and this beautifully kept dame set in stunning surrounds had charm a plenty. Our suite even though on the bottom floor on the backside of the hotel still had nice views and was an excellent room. Because we had booked a suite we had access to the well appointed regency club room. Very luxurious with great views of the ample pool area. We enjoyed the buffets on 2 nights which were both  ample and value. The traditional Javanese dancing was a highlight for sure.  All in all, great place, great staff, great service and Totally lovely staff"
"Stayed for 5 nights- to relax and visit temples. Excellent hotel- beautiful pool area- an oasis of peace in the middle of a city! Lovely friendly helpful pool staff! Same throughout the hotel . Without exception staff very attentive and helpful and always smiling! Loved this place and would stay again. Advantage of having own tour operator here as well-Angsa tour Indonesia- so hotel gave me their email details and we arranged tours before we came-great tour guide and Driver-Wowon and Sam,thanks to them for agreat tour. Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!"
"Very nice hotel, nice design ,green and nature ambience.good staff and awesome of service. Good food and nice outlet restaurant.but i think really need renewal some of point especially at room.seems like old accent."
"Overall excellent, clean room, free WiFi, free shuttle bus from hotel to malioboro street, free swimming pool, free golf, food very delicious, view hotel very beautiful, all staff hotel very helpfull,   "
"Swimming pool in Hyatt Regency Hotel Jogjakarta should be opened until at least 21 pm. Hyatt Regency hotel Jogjakarta must keep Gudeg (signature dish of Jogjakarta) in their breakfast buffet menu.  Health Club in Hyatt Regency Hotel Jogjakarta must be immediately renovated, particularly in the Jacuzzi area and cupboard looks quite old and dirty which create image old and lousy hotel."
"Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta was more than we expected. All staffs are very friendly and kindly. Lovely garden and swimming pool. The location is not near downtown, but the shuttle bus is convenient. My friend and I staid for 3 nights. Wish we could stay for longer."
"Hyatt yogya is what we called home in yogya. We practicly stayed there every single time. The room as cozy as its expected, its clean and have a good air circulation. The staff very friendly, So much activity in the hotel, can ride a bike, fishing with the kids and have andong ride around the hotel. It was so much fun. The food was great."
Beautiful setting with lots of greenery. Hotel captures the feel of many of the surrounding attractions. Several nice places to eat incl. golf club. Spectacular pool area. Runs a shuttle service to the city every two hours. Friendly and helpful staff.
"++ - good view. - big pool, my daughter so happy with that. - the staff always say hi to me - easy &amp; fast to check in/out  -- - the furniture to old - need to add breakfast variations - need to add children activity"
"Golf course, tennis, swimming pools, spa, great massage, exceptional service and beautiful rooms. Buffet breakfast to die for. Take advantage of the Regancy Club with special check in/out, free drinks and buffet for breakfast and cocktail hours."
"Excellent service, incredible food, quiet and beautiful building and grounds. Very kid friendly but also adult friendly. Enjoyed eating waffles, cheese, fruit, eggs, etc. for breakfast. AC in room works great and the bath tub is aweome. The pool and waterslide are amazing and beautiful."
Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta was more than I expected. All staffs are more than ready to listen what customer needs. Lovely garden and golf course and also swimming pool was enough to amuse to people who wants to get relaxation. I will stay again when I visit there!
"It&#39;s a nice place to relax and spend your time, located next to golf course, and nice jogging path in the golf course. Nice rooms and comfortable beds. Nice views from the sit out areas, sun rise... The mount Merapi can be seen from the sitout area. "
"Went to the hotel for family gathering. The room was decent, staff were ok. The plus of the hotel is the big garden and golf course that is adjacent to the hotel.  Got the romantic feel and quietness. Located in the suburb of Yogyakarta. But pretty convenient to travel to the centre of the city, one straight drive to the Tugu Monument and Malioboro Street. I&#39;d stay at this hotel if I were to go golfing whilst enjoying the quiet surrounding.  "
Hospitality is key. Well trained staff always at your service. The premise is a bit far from the city centre but the space and the facilities make it up. My family and I stated for 3 nights. Wish we could stay for a longer time.
"This hotel is the only hotel in Jogja with amazing golf course and also jogging track. With green view around hotel and also towards Merapi Mountain, the hotel provides a stunning view that could not be found elsewhere in Jogja.  With great swimming pool, great customer service and also great food, the stay experience is unmatched by other hotels at the same price range..."
"The property of the hotel is huge and beautiful, and the staff are extremely polite and helpful. But the quality of the rooms were not up to the mark. They were very basic, and small. A bit disappointing.  Also the quality of the food needs to be upgraded."
"An extraordinary property and excellent service. The rooms and bathrooms are just aging but otherwise everything is superb. Breakfast is fabulous, everything you need in a dreamscape. I think the most important thing is that it integrates into the air from Yogyakarta. Even if it is further from the center go with confidence is super."
"aside from the luxirous they offer, things that need to get highlight is the traditional atmosphere the hotel offer from food and complimentary things. For you who are an international place who want to stay in a luxirous yet can feel the &quot;Jogja&quot; atmosphere. Hyatt is totally reccomended comparing others 5 star hotel like Tentrem Hotel"
"once you arrive at the hotel, you will feel different ambience from the bustling city. Its so tranquil. Great facilities inside. 4 swimming pools. Long jogging track. Golf course. beautiful garden. health club. even free horse carriage ride. "
"And taste good.It&#39;s 30 minutes from the airport,and there is free horsecart ride for the hotel guests.Friendly staff,clean room,free wifi at all hotel area.They also have nice spa&amp;massage service.Perfect place to stay with your family."
"The good place to stay with ur family in vacation,so green and the food very tasty. The first time stay in hyatt regency and it not disspointed,the service good,about the food?hmmm...its heaven coz its so many food ur can try"
"Stayed for four nights at this property! Loved the entire place! Nice compact none hole gol course, small but fun! Location fairly great and staff good! Only negative, rooms could do with some upgrade! Great value for money! Awesome sightseeing and nice shopping!"
"The hotel needs to have new decoration, new furniture, the service is good and Gardens are beautifull! Nice Breakfast with variegue. We stay 3 night to visit Borobudur and Prambanan! Nice location with shutle to Meliboro mall ."
"Let&#39;s start by stating the obvious: if you like nature and need some peace, you are at the right place. The hotel has an immense garden, and a golf course with an amazing view of Mount Merapi. It also has a very convenenient location if yoi want to visit Prambanan temple, 30 min by car (you can order a car from the hotel, and the driver will stay with you for 3 hours, for 330.000 rupiah).  On saturday you can also watch the Ramayana ballet, that is if you cannot go and watch it outside (in our case we found it more convenient as we were with a small baby).  Breakfast is excellent with a very wide variety of choices, and lunch and dinner can be either buffet or a la carte. They are of course pricier than any restaurant outsid but let me share this: we arrived late, tired and</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel is very nice, the environment, the grounds, the staff, the golf course, the gardens, and the pools are wonderful; however, the hotel has the potential to be exceptional. Yet lack of attention to typical maintenance issues, and updating facilities and decor, limit my ability to highly recommend this hotel to other guests who are expecting an international class of hotel.  The whirlpool in the health club is in significant need of updating, towels in the guest rooms need to be replaced regularly, and not used to the point of being worn, lighting fixtures in the bathrooms are old and slightly rusted, faucets etc. need to be updated, drains need to be cleaned so that water drains out efficiently. All of these minor details add up over the course of the stay and leave a</span><span>&hellip;"
"We came to Yogyakarta for the first three nights of our honeymoon, to visit Borabadur in particular and were not disappointed by the hotel. The staff were welcoming, helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived and even gave us an evening in the club regency bar to sample the food and drinks there.   The hotel itself was stunning and the front had actually been modelled on Borabadur itself! The swimming lagoon was fantastic with so many different areas to sit and swim and the large water slide through a temple was really fun!  We thoroughly enjoyed the food and the breakfasts were delicious. There was so much choice of Indonesian and western food with chefs on hand to make dishes to order right before your eyes. My favourite was the fruit and vegetable juice bar.  The only</span><span>&hellip;"
"Yes, this  Hyatt  Regency is not centrally located  in the city of Yogyakarta; however, if your purpose of visiting Yogyakarta is to visit Borobudur and Prambanan and the rest of the &#39;candis&#39;; this location works to your advantage since you are  hardly encountered heavy traffic congestion. The hotel landscape is utterly magnificent and completed with nine hole golf course. Entrance with amazing view, the lobby, down the stairs to the breakfast area of indoor and outdoor flow beautifully to the swimming pool. We were checked in at the Club lobby, and yes, Club rooms has access to this Club lounge Cocktail which is not only it is convenient but also relaxing and a good and easy way to sample a few of local dishes. We are familiar with the  Indonesian Gado- gado ( salad) but after</span><span>&hellip;"
"We loved everything about the hotel. Friendly and resourceful staff, very nice room, comfortable bed and clean bathroom, good buffet lunch and dinner and a la carte options and a very peaceful surrounding. Recommend to all! "
"We stay here three nights and the staff couldn&#39;t have been more accommodating, always smiling and asking if we needed anything. The grounds are lush and reason enough to stay here. We loved the availability of the many pools for us and for the children playing. If I had children, this would be a perfect place. The breakfast is off-the-charts amazing. The food and the service were top notch. Outside seating is poolside with a great view of fountains. I agree with others that the Hyatt has not undergone a recent renovation but the room is comfortable and nicely furnished. There&#39;s a classic feel to the rooms. The complimentary shuttle was much appreciated because we were more than walking distance to the center of Yogyakarta. With the friendliness of the staff and the beautiful</span><span>&hellip;"
"The moment that we stepped off the transportation and stepped into the hotel, we were impressed with the beautiful entrance and picturesque grounds.  The lobby is also nicely set up in white marbles.  We were eager to see our rooms with high expectations.  Unfortunately, our room was not up to the standard typically in accordance with Hyatt.  It is small, basic and old, like the Marriott you stay in the 2nd or 3rd tier cities in US.  The breakfast buffet is also nothing to write home about.  The dining options are very limited as well with lackluster menus.  Fortunately, the price was quite reasonable.  You could get away with less than US$100 a night.  So can&#39;t complain too much ..."
Very good property. Peaceful but still accessible. The hotel itself has several activities and also facilities that make the stay pleasant. I would definitely recommend this hotel. And i would also love to come back and spend some extra days.
"Very nice hotel, the garden is the most beautiful hotel garden I have ever seen. Room is average but the comfort of the bed and pillows make up for it! The breakfast is incredible but diner was a bit expensive. The pool has a slide, yes a slide you read me right"
"I always looking forward to return to this great hotel, and Also this year it&#39;s still a joy to come back. Specially for families it is lovely with their landscaped garden and superb pool with slide, kids love it.Also the staff is doing their utmost to let you feel at home. Breakfast is one of the best in town to enjoy under the trees in the garden for only Rp.100.000 Thanks again for the nice upgrade Budi &amp; See you next year ! "
"We went to Jogja for a long weekend with family. The hotel is a quick trip from the airport, and the grounds are absolutely beautiful. Nice golf course, walking path, and the swimming pools (and slide!) were loved by out entire  group. Check-in was really easy, and since we were Hyatt Platinum, we were checked in up in the lounge, which is always a nice touch. We found the staff to be very friendly and attentive across the board.  We took advantage of their car service to book trips to Prambanan and Borobudur and we used the shuttle to head down to Malioboro- all nice amenities!   The disappointment, and it was a big one, was the quality of the rooms- they were really shabby. Our junior suite had a stained and worn carpet, the couch was threadbare, stained and uncomfortable, the</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel is very beautiful, it is surrounded by lush garden and a breathtaking view of a golf course. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was beautiful as well, the room was standard size, not too big nor too small. The buffet was amazing, with amazing view as well outdoor. It seems like a different world there amidst the hustle bustle of the city outside. Totally recommended!"
"Feel like home for pleasure and stays for business trip. Perfect room size and all the supporting facilities, including the 9 holes golf courses. Everyday is wonderful stays. I will come again on next visit for family vacation."
"Stayed for 5 days with my wife, kids and parents. Day 1 of stay, my kid got sick so we had to stay in the hotel for 5 days straight. Luckily, parents ended up scouring every nook and cranny of the hotel and there&#39;s enough entertainment inside the hotel even when you have to stay in.  Beautiful rooms, fantastic views, awesome service and staff are wonderful! Will definitely be back."
"Beautiful hotel with many facilities, a great pool and delicious food ( especially the breakfast buffet). A remote place in a busy city. The place looks also wonderful at night to with all the decorations covered in light. Top hotel!"
I really like this hotel and the experience that the hotel provides during my business trip here. They have spacious room where I could feel comfortable and private balcony to experience a bit &quot;quality time&quot; with myself. The Kemangi Bistro have a nice poolside view and the outdoor part of the bistro is wonderful with beautiful tree. The bar also have a nice view near golf field. Would absolutely stay at this hotel on another occasion!
"Great complex with a beautiful swimming pool in the middle of the nature, and excellent service provided by the staff. Definitely recommend this hotel when visiting Yogyakarta. Only drawback is the distance to town which can take up to 45 min in case of traffic and about 15 min when no traffic."
"Whenever we visit Indonesia, this American and my Indonesian wife of 11years plan our visits around this fabulous hotel resort. I have never been treated like this place treats me. We are addressed like royalty, like family, like the most important couple on the planet. From the GM right down to the genuinely pleasant and extremely accomadating staff, one would be hard pressed to find better service anywhere. It is our favorite of all the places we have stayed: throughout the US, Europe, the UAE, etc. the breakfast includes everything imaginable from traditional Indonesian/Asian/ Middle Eastern to everything that any Westerner could desire. The pool has to be seen to believe along with its Borobudur replica water slide. A nine hole executive style golf course is fun with very</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed for 4 days at Hyatt and had the chance to get upgraded! It made our stay even greater. The hotel is splendid, gardens are astonishing as well as the golf course. My daughter loved the slide built on a reproduction of an Indonesian temple.buffets for breakfasts and dinners were great as well, people smiling and great service We ll come back with great pleasure "
"The hyatt hotel grounds is breathtaking! its a big wow!   the landscaped gardens, ponds, temple structures in the garden and the swimming pool just gives you a calming, peaceful and meditative feeling.  However, i feel the rooms are dated and needs to be renovated with new furnishings and upholstery. Also, towels were tired and old. It is a good thing i brought my own towel. We stayed at the club floor where we had access to the executive lounge. It is a better place to eat compared to the main dining area downstairs which i find kinda dark and gloomy. Servers were very polite and willing to please but were not good at english so we had moments where we could not understand each other. The most disappointing part of our stay was the food. They had so many offerings ( mostly</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed at this beautiful hotel in June 2016. The rooms are good size, sleep quality beautiful, clean, well appointed. The dining area is large with comfortable seating &amp; ample choice. USP is separate menu for KIds, Vegetarians(though limited).  Break- fast is lavish. We stayed on the seventh floor, corner room. Added advantage was an attached terrace. The swing pool is large, with different pools nicely connected to each other. Don&#39;t miss the spa &amp; golf. The hotel is run efficiently by caring staff. The most beautiful aspect is the safe, well maintained, eye soothing landscaped gardens. The stupa is nicely integrated with water bodies , blooming lotuses &amp; the sitting deck offers a panoramic view. We had a very restful stay."
"as the tittle said, the best hotel ever... and the price is almost ridiculous comparing the service and beautiness...  I am not a luxury hotel fan but we discoved this one by &quot;accident&quot; looking a for a nice place to have diner for a special day and the day after we check-out the hotel we stayed to come to the Hyatt"
The Carpet must be the original 20 year old or more carpets.  We were told the hotel was built in 1996 but it looks more like 1980.  Foot paths needing updating but very nice grounds.  Very small fitness center about the size of a walk in closet with only 3 or 4 weight machines and it is in a small building out past the pool.  The Pool is very nice and the lobby in nice but the property sits in the middle of a poor part of the city so you will need to take a car to really see anything in the area.  Food is average for the breakfast buffet but not impressive.  They don&#39;t even have a Juicer machine.  The Juice staff actually uses a blender to blend the fruit or veggies then strains it in a metal strainer and then adds water from a plastic jug and serves it Runny Very Runny.  The</span><span>&hellip;
You know you&#39;re in a special place right from the moment you walk in the door and smell the check-in area. It&#39;s like being taken to a special oasis. The breakfast is incredible and lasts until late in the morning. Both the American and the Indonesian options are exceptional. The pool is out of this world and even features a water slide and a super fun kid&#39;s pool and a swing. The grounds are large with plenty of space to walk around in the shade. There are even sidewalks that you can use a stroller on. Highly recommended stop while in Indonesia.
"With beautiful landscaping, classic design, complete facilities, strategic  location &amp; friendly service, this place has it all. But the swimming pool is the star of this hotel! The resort-like design makes us forgot that we&#39;re in the middle of a busy city. "
"We were staying there in June 2016 and it was just lovely. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and made all our wishes come true. Breakfast was almost too much to comprehend, quality was superb. If we ever make it back in this region, we will definitely stay come back to Hyatt."
On July 2016 i stayed at hyatt regency yogyakarta on saturday. Hyatt regency located in north side of yogyakarta near kaliurang its quite far from downtown. Hotel was nice full of plants i love green hotel. This hotel also big. They had big swimming pool with water slide. And also golf fields. Ok my weekend it must be great. I arrived around 1 pm. But i got uppset because i need 1 hour to checked in. After wait for 1 hours i got room in 5ft floor. Room was nice and warm i got coconuts view if you lucky you can get mount merapi view or golf view. Room quite old yaa maybe because its like an old hotel. Swimming pool was nice. They design like in waterboom. Every saturday night day held ramayana night market. You can eat indonesian food banquet. With ramayana dance performs. The</span><span>&hellip;
"This was one of the better places that I stayed.    The service was superb.  I was greeted at the door with a fresh jasmine necklace that I wore all day.  This was one of the nicest touches and will always remind me of Indonesia. They let me  check-in early and late checkout.    The architecture is more western.  The menu in the club hyatt was very western.  It was interesting to get an authentic fresh slice of challah in the middle of Java.  It was a good changeup for a day.  The grounds were great.  I am not much one for hotel pools or swimming, but I had to try this one.  The pool and water slide was a lot of fun. The pool wraps around and is extensive.  I could, and did, spend an hour just walking around the outside of the grounds without even stepping on to the golf course.</span><span>&hellip;"
"Was stay here for 5 days, room so so, breakfast was really good, and great pool...very friendly staff and good services...location not that close with center but good hotel for family...well they have very interesting show every weekend with traditional food and music...exactly will stay here again when I come back to Yogyakarta...."
"Wife and two kids (13 &amp; 10) stayed here in 2 rooms. Excellent facilities, brilliant pool, expansive grounds and a good base to explore Yogyakarta. Great food at the restaurant and in particular the local dishes. Given buffet, I was able to try a lot of different Javanese dishes especially desserts. There is a tour operator conveniently located within the hotel and we organized a couple of trips including a Mount Merapi trek (me and 13yo son). Definitely will stay here again next time. "
"This member of the Hyatt family doesn&#39;t disappoint - wonderful service, great F&amp;B options, extremely lush pool surroundings, and a jogging track round the hotel - nice touch!  Rooms are well-equipped and cosy, and on the whole it was a brilliant experience. It is extremely value-for-money and I would suggest it to be your top choice if you&#39;re looking for a some luxury in Yogyakarata just a little bit away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Shuttle trips into the city centre are provided; they are free but must be booked in advance."
This is a five star hotel with private golf course so during your stay you can play golf as well. The staff is very helpful even though some of them is slow when response your ask for help. The breakfast menu is very complete.
"We only stayed there for one night but it gave us enough impression to write a rewiev on here. We were greeted with a big smile, jasmine petal chain around the neck and a refreshing cocktail but as soon as we left, there was no smile and none holding the doors open and handling the lagguage as they did when we arrived...It did feel like once you&#39;ve payed the $$$ you were just a number. Really disappointing feeling. Additionally we had a argument with the taxi service called &quot;golden bird&quot;. They make up a price by a package that totally doesn&#39;t make any sense! First we wanted to see the Prambanan temple and then go to Magelang to stay there in a hotel. They charged us 350 RM for 4 hours. Then we had to change the plan as I was feeling poorly ( due to headache) and had to skipp the</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel has a very nice atmosphere and ground, but does rate as a 5 star hotel by Hyatt standards. The staff are nice, but really don&#39;t understand what you want or expect.  While the hotel stay is nice, it is not what one would come to expect from this chain&#39;s top end."
"My Wife and I stayed at Hyatt Regency for one week from 18/7-24/7, we were welcome with amazing hospitality and friendship. From the concierge (Mas Rudy and his team), Mrs Dharmayanti and his FO team (Kenan, Fitra and Manggala), Mbak Sri and Mas Ery with their colleagues, the Housekeeping staff clean your room very clean, Mr Kasno. Last but not least this is the hard work and leadership from Pak Nurchayadi- the GM with the support from Pak Renzo-F&amp;B Director and Pak Joko - the Director of engineer had made our one week stay at Hyatt Regency like our home. Amazing friendly and Profesional staff that attend to you, the standard room is big and clean, selection of buffet breakfast is good.  We were there to attend the wedding of my Niece and the Hyatt Ballroom.  Pak Renzo and Chef</span><span>&hellip;"
"The HYATT Yogyakarta is a marvel.  The Borobudur-shaped hotel is beautiful, the staff wonderful, and the view on the Merapi volcano superb. Booking the Regency Club package is a smart idea. The Club access allows for a comfortable stay, out of the fuzz, and when monetizing the package benefits, it proofs to be equally expensive when booking a standard room, plus breakfast and dining."
"How we love this hotel. Quite room to stay, large enough, clean and traditional. Bed and extra like homy. Great bathroom with bathtub, how nice i take a bath so long in warm water :)  The Pool so happy to swim with my children, very lovely, my children want to go back here next visit.  This hotel have a large yard to explore a green garden and traditional temple we can see there around with bicycle.  Dinner BBQ and breakfast ready. Delicious taste."
"Awesome Banquest Team&#39;s Services, they have very polite attitude for client who running the event in the Ballroom. I&#39;m really appreciate for that. This place is very recommended for your bussiness conference or just internal meeting."
"Superb hotel - delicious kitchen, excellent spa, very friendly personnel. Rooms are large and clena with perfect bathroom.  Downsides : the nice bar is empty - we satvthere Aline being Wauters on by 6... Swimming pool is not very clean, proces of wine are high."
"I stayed at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for 3 days 2 nights with my family.We love the 4 swimming pools especially the 70m slide for my children.The hotel has a beautiful landscape and numbers of children&#39;s activities,but what impress me more is the staff&#39;s attitude,the smile and the greeting where ever we are in the restaurant,hallway,lobby and pools.I personally thankyou for the help of Mr.Denny Hidayat (Director of Sales) to arrange the transportation for my mother who unable to walk far due to old age and hip operation to go the restaurant outside the hotel complex.We all really happy to choose to stay here for our family holiday.Thankyou.Keep it up."
"After spending time in Bali and Jakarta, Yogyakarta was the final leg of our journey. As a family of four, we don&#39;t usually stay in five star accommodation but thought we&#39;d indulge ourselves for a week. At first glance, the hotel is impressive with the grounds, front lobby and restaurant, however we were soon brought back to earth when we were shown the room. With the extra rollaway bed for our 11 year old and the king bed for my wife, 7 year old and me to share there was very little room to move. The bathroom was also small and tired. Sure we could have booked an extra room for the girls but that would have doubled the price of our stay which we couldn&#39;t justify. It&#39;s only natural to compare accommodation, and we&#39;d just come from a spacious 2 bedroom apartment in central</span><span>&hellip;"
"Our experience in this Hyatt hotel was memorable. We didn&#39;t like Yogyakarta and the Hyatt was a balsam and a place we really enjoyed. It has a phenomenal environment, with spectacular swimming pool, golf, tennis court, paths to walk...and the rooms are lovely. But the best thing is service. Kindness and a truly interest in helping the visitor are for us the most remarkable fact about Hyatt. We had a problem with a taxi and they helped to solve it, bearing in mind it is a country we don&#39;t speak its language and to solve a problem can be specially disturbing.  Delicious. "
"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 5D4N. The hotel is excellent for young family. There was horse cart, fishing pool and a huge pool for kids to be entertained. The grounds were beautiful and the service was excellent. The restaurant, Kemangi, is a great place to explore local cuisine. Its Ramayana Night on Sat is excellent to catch the ballet, Ramayana, in a comfortable setting esp with a young toddler. The hotel is in a relative central location to visit Borobodur and Prambanan temple."
"The hotel setting is gorgeous, especially the entrance and gardens. The rooms are a bit disappointing, after seeing the beautiful common areas, the rooms seem a bit outdated and do not match the quality of the rest of the hotel. It is located outside the town centre which is not ideal, but there is a shuttle with limited space available. The staff are very helpful. The place is great for a relaxing trip, where you can enjoy the pool, the spa, the food and a good centre to explore everything that Yogyakarta has to offer."
"Beautiful hotel amids wonderfull lush green gardens. The room was a bit dated, but the facilities easily compensated this. The gardens and pools are amazing and breakfast was a real feast! Would not hesitate to go back there! An oasis of rest in the centre of Jogja ..."
Especially enjoyed the Restaurant ! Prices were fantastic lots to choose from  Breakfast Buffett amazing The staff was super friendly and most spoke English  Beautiful grounds and nice clean rooms  Located a bit out of town but taxis are always available
"I stayed here for 2 nights.16-17 th july.it is an amazing hotel with tremandous service.i am surprised to experience their survice altogether.at the lobby,reception,concious,restaurant.it is realy appreciatable.it has great amusement for the guest.i took horse cart ride,ramayana night market &amp; malioboro tour.it has a blue bird car service which is also nice with good quality english speaking driver.swimming pool area is awesome.spa is good but not outstanding.golf ground is terrificly beautiful.the hotel has lavish interior &amp; architectural design and decoration.it has everything what a guest desire.altogether highly recommended hotel in yogyakarta."
"Hotel Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is the only choice for travellers to Yogyakarta be they business travellers or tourists. The hotel is large and set in extensive and beautiful gardens complimented by an excellent pool and golf course, a great restaurant and bar as well as a wonderful spa and professional business facilities.   The rooms are large, well appointed and comfortable, the cleanliness of the hotel is a priority for its clever and welcoming staff. Whilst the grounds, rooms and features of the hotel are outstanding it is the staff that make any stay here special. The warmth and professionalism displayed by the staff throughout my long stay here was impressive. They are thoughtful, diligent and charming and their high level of training and professionalism was appreciated. </span><span>&hellip;"
"we held a meeting at this hotel followed by a couple more days of R&amp;R. It is a very large property with an expansive pool and spa and a golf course (albeit on the small side), which -according g to the golfer of the group- was quite decent, especially early in the morning. The staff was very helpful both during the meeting as well as on an individual level.  Our rooms opened to the yard and the golf course and were pleasant with all the customary amenities. The breakfast buffet was wonderful with tastes of the orient, local and european, and real coconut milk, which bears no resemblance to the one available in the supermarkets of the western world. The pool is sprawled over different levels particularly suitable to kids.  On occasion, especially when on a business trip with a</span><span>&hellip;"
"the location of this hotel is not quite at the heart of the city which is great for a weekend get away.. you do not need to get anywhere else for a relaxing weekend.. the pool is great and the food and drink offered here is just delicious, the hotel is children friendly and the staff are friendly"
"On arrival we were greeted with a flower necklace, checked in by a lovely lady who showed us to the waiting area. We were provided some refreshments and all I had to do was sign for the key! Inside the deluxe room awaits the most wonderful balcony/terrace overlooking the golf course! The room was and is spotless. Room service is fantastic. The food, don&#39;t even get me started! We&#39;d been on a one week trip from Jakarta down, and the Bistro has the BEST food so far. we&#39;ve eaten here every night it&#39;s that good. You can&#39;t knock a Hyatt, and this one is certainly impressive. Stop reading this and book it... Now."
"The Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta has nice grounds, many activities, children friendly and within near distances from some of the best restaurants in town. The staff were friendly and helpful. Free andong rides were also provided for hotel guests. However, the rooms and especially the bathrooms were old, a bit unclean and very standard. The two rooms we had had problems with wifi and network signal was almost non-existent. It also made ordering room service problematic for us as we had to do the ordering online instead of just picking up the phone. Overall, the rooms were overpriced for what we get and major renovations seems necessary to uplift this beautiful property to its previous splendour befitting its prestigious name."
"Stayed for 1 night,in 1st floor. Great garden,great pool (my children loved it),great staff,good price,various choice of breakfast. But the room has a bit moldy smell. But overall still a great stay. Still recommended."
"Stayed 4 nights with group of 3 rooms during holidays.  It&#39;s a mix feeling, this hotel was established in second half of nineties, the entrance was nice with some big banyan trees that give the ambiance of old Java, lobby was clean as aspected from the brand, staff were friendly and helpfull that&#39;s it.  Rooms are old and dull, the bathroom are long time due for total refurbishment, a lot of marks and dirty (black spot) anti skid mat for  the bath tube...which were not expected for this big hotel chain. Day two..staff forgot to provide bottled water, day three they did not provide towel for extra bed...but all solved after calling the service.  Breakfast was excellent with lack of service due to high season, which should not happened.  Landscape shown old and need more caring,</span><span>&hellip;"
"If you are looking for a relaxing venue with lush gardens and an amazing swimming pool, this is the place to stay.  The Hyatt Regency is situated on the outskirts of Jogja,  some 20 minutes away from the city center.  Its location is convenient, too, for those wishing to visit Borobudur.  This hotel resort features tennis courts, a landscaped golf course, views of Mount Merapi, and pleasant dining areas. From the moment we received jasmine garlands at check-in until we drove off two days later, we were assisted by a very well-trained, service-oriented, and friendly staff who went the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable.  The room was spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable with lots of amenities. Breakfast was superb with a myriad of choices. Eating at the tables placed in the</span><span>&hellip;"
"A really big Hotel with green surrounding. Especially the kids love the fishing ponds.  Breakfast is varied and great choices. But as with other big city Hotel, staff lacks smile to local travelers :-("
"Yogyakarta as well as the HYATT in Yogyakarta both make you feel you want to come back.  I did already many times.  Each time they manage to surprise me with new features. The staff is attentive, friendly, well-mannered, and willing to assist. The outdoor lobby terrace with the view on Mount Merapi is priceless."
"We love this hotel!!! They have big swimming pool with big slide which is my kids favorite part of this hotel, they don&#39;t want to get off from the swimming pool :) We love riding the bike around the golf course and the Tennis courts. Got a nice view of the Mount Merapi from our rooms and breakfast was lovely... The staff are amazing, and they have Andong ride for free around the hotel for the guest which is again is a plus for this hotel... Can&#39;t wait to go back...! "
"hotel is just outside Yogjakarta (1/2 hr by taxi). But also on the way to Borobudor and to the other side Kraton Palace.  Staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is amazing, continental, local, fruits, smoothies, everything! Swimming pool is good, also for children (slides). Evening entertainment. Rooms are good and spacious."
"Our family love the hotel, kids really enjoyed their pool, they didn&#39;t want to leave this place. Breakfast great with lots of selection, also serve local foods and jamu (healthy herb drinks from Java).The hotel is super big, your kids will kept busy the whole day...  Location is a bit far from the city but taxi is cheap and Jogja is pretty small. Just avoid peak season on Lebaran Day, June and December, the time when Jogja is packed with domestic tourist and the traffic is crazy.   We just love Hyatt... We tried Bandung, Jogja and Nusa Dua Bali... All great... "
"This hotel offered a lot of greenery and beautiful landscape. It is a good place to stay with a family. Although it is located in the outskirt, it will take only around 15-20 minutes to the city  center. Room&#39;s a bit small but compensate by the view. Breakfast is good with a lot of food choice."
The garden and Golf view is nice and the air is fresh. The location is closed to the city. The food is very good. The staff is very good and helpful. The outside area of the hotel is the golf area which is very good for jogging and family gathering.
"The resort is very expansive and it is beautiful. The rooms however need some renovation as they are outdated and not that well kept- same goes for washroom. But overall this is a very beautiful place to yogayakarta, you get direct views of the volcanic mountain. They also run direct shuttles to the market which is very helpful."
"Have been to many Hyatts. The welcome and service was really impressive. Very friendly, very personal. It&#39;s a resort-style hotel, so lots of amenities if you like those. The room was a bit outdated to be fair, but the hotel itself and it&#39;s staff makes this a really great place to stay!"
"Hyatt in Indonesia, as well as other American hotels in the country, are all very well made and quite glamorous at times. I have been coming and going to Indonesia for the past 10 years, and American hotels never disappoint.   Like many international hotels, this place has its own complex and security wall almost. Standard for many parts of Indo.  Hotel grounds are stunning. The pool is built to show some similarity with Prambanan, Borobudur, and just gives you that exotic feel. Also has a beautiful golf course you can see from outside the lobby.  Service, like many other American hotels in Indo is amazing. They give you free massages while you wait for checkin. Flower lei&#39;s given to you when you arrive.  Only issue I think is the rooms are bit dated and old. Clean nonetheless,</span><span>&hellip;"
"The Jogja Hyatt Regency is the best hotel. We love the grounds, the pool, housekeeping (Wulan is so wonderful), the Regency Club, Kemangi Bistro and on-and-on.   The hotel is modeled after Borobudur. Yogyakarta is home to this largest Buddhist temple in the world.   The view of Merapi is spectacular from the hotel.   You will not find a better hotel in Jogja. "
"I love just how you step into a whole different environment the moment you enter the hotel. Lots of greenery around as there is a golf course built in as well. What I love is the design of the hotel. They also organized cycling tours which I enjoyed. Food is reasonable, but I would suggest eating out."
"We stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel is lovely, the staff are very friendly and the gardens are beautiful and very relaxing. The hotel is well placed for visiting Borobudur (1hour) and Prambanan (35 mins). It about 15-30 mins from the city centre/Malioboro Street depending on the traffic. The hotel is quiet and green. The swimming pools are lovely and there is a 2km walking jogging track.  The rooms was nothing fancy but clean and well appointed.  The travel desk was great, very reactive organising things on the day for us. To my surprise I actually prefered this hotel to the previous one, where we stayed in Dec. There are other restaurants within walking distance."
"What a nice hotel. Friendly staff, good food, perfect breakfast buffet indoor and outdoor. Huge poolarea and golf course. I give &quot;five stars&quot;, although the hotel could need a renovation. Two watertubs (each for hot and cold water), shower curtain in the bathroom is not the equipment you expect in 2016. Also the poolarea is great, but it&#39;s visible, that modern tiles are needed. If I would be in the area again, i would make a reservation in this hotel, again"
"Its a Hyatt like I expect a Hyatt. Its not new, its great, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is like I expect at a 5 Star Hotel.  The rooms are nice, actually a bit old and the bathroom could need a small renovation. The cleanliness is good, could be a bit better.  Maintaining is another point... It looks funny if every light in your room has another color but I guess it is not part of the design.   F&amp;B is as expected,  Sadly they don&#39;t serve a high tea at afternoon.  The Pool, the Park and the Golf course are amazing.  The Spa is great, the Staff amazing and the treatment perfect. Polite and trained. Please don&#39;t forget to Tip the Staff because the basic sellary is very low in there.   Overall I enjoyed my stay and will come back again. "
"Makes you feel like kings and queens. Perfect for the whole family. Love the pool, it feels like a theme park. The breakfast is fabulous. Rooms are clean and the staff is very hospitable without being intrusive. Very relaxing."
"we need to pay a bit much for this, but it&#39;s all totally worth it, totally. the service, food, facilities, everything. is literally good. however, it&#39;s a bit far from the most-go-to places like malioboro, tugu jogja, prawirotaman, and so on. but this hotel is still one of my favs so far."
"We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is beautiful and situated in such a way that it is well integrated with lush gardens and koi ponds all around. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable we had a little balcony with a table and two chairs which was a nice little bonus. Our favorite place to spend time was the pool which was huge and surrounded by plants as trees giving it a very tropical jungle feel. The breakfast buffet was well worth the additional charge as they had everything you could possibly want.   The only thing that brought the rating down from 5 stars to the 4 which I am rating it is on our last night, we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant. However when we went there, to our surprise there was an event going on with</span><span>&hellip;"
"It was great. The staff, especiall yMr  Budi took great care of us. Made our family holiday worthwhile. The food was superb, especially the breakfast buffet. Great location and amazing hospitality. Will visit again."
"It&#39;s my 5th or 6th time staying at this hotel. So far, nothing change, it&#39;s still my best and favourite hotel in Yogya. Location: Not really in the city centre, a bit far for major tourist spots (Malioboro street, the Sultan Palace, Bringhardjo Market, etc). You need to take taxi/car to reach other places.  But it makes very quiet and peaceful. It has golf course next to the hotel. My favourite spot of this hotel is the outdoor lounge where you can enjoy the view of Golf Course  and amazing Merapi mountain, especially in the morning.  Room: Nice, huge, clean and very well maintained. good amenities. Something you can expect from Hyatt standard.  Service &amp; Facilities: very very nice pool. my favourite so far. huge pool,  some area covered by trees. very relaxing. Restaurant is</span><span>&hellip;"
"I wasn&#39;t too sure what to expect from this hotel, the price was very cheap so I wasn&#39;t expecting much, but it was amazing! From the moment you walk into the entrance and lobby we were &#39;wowed&#39; by the beauty of the hotel. The room was a reasonable size and comfortable. The multi-level pool is superb - lush gardens and overhanding trees around bridges and water slides - wonderful!"
"This hotel is placed nothern Yogyakarta, has a great views of Merapi Mt. Great place to take a rest with your family.  Hyatt Yogyakarta seems built for those who want to escape from the crowded. If you just want to escape from a routine activities,this place is just perfect!  Food isn&#39;t really fit with Indonesian&#39;s tounge. But really good for foreigners"
"We stayed two nights, we enjoyed to see Borobudur Temple and Prambanan Temple and others.  Also, beautiful landscape on the Hotel, all staff friendly and professional attitude and well trained. But I felt this hotel basic concept of marketing are wondering the city business hotel or resort hotel."
"I regulary visited this hotel for Sunday brunch and in house. The staff always nice and helpful. Beautiful huge garden with nice golf  and jogging track, also good place for family activity. Always nice to stay at this resort hotel and surely coming back again and again"
"It was my first time to Jogjakarta.  I was in this hotel for 4N5D.  Checkin was efficiently done.  I was greeted by happy, smiling faces.  A welcome drink was served and a touch of warm hospitality through a garland of jasmine flowers was placed around my neck.  To my surprise, a 5mins massage was given and it sure was comforting after having travelled for quite awhile.   Room No : 0518.  Spacious, quiet, clean, white sheets to sleep on and spotless, white towels were provided.  Sleep quality : Excellent, pin drop silence for a good night&#39;s sleep. Breakfast : A wide array of dishes both local and western. Location : It&#39;s 20minutes drive away from the shopping area.  Free shuttle service is provided to the guests.  However, one needs to do a prior reservation with the reception.</span><span>&hellip;"
I was face the worst service during Ramadhan month. This hotel mostly valid for the people that are not fasting. The food and beverage served fully for people that they are not taking the fasting. Totally disappointed.
The staff is beyond friendly! They are very polite and well versed in english.  The check in process was a breeze with a welcome drink and a short massage. Their service is sublime. They helped settle alot of things for us during our stay here.  The hotel grounds and room are clean. A gem in jogga indeed.  What more can you ask for?
"Our family of four stayed at the Hyatt from 7 to 10 June. They gave us adjoined rooms as requested and found the rooms to be in very clean and good conditions ( not sure why there are so many complaints about the room maintenance). Their staffs are kind, friendly and helpful. The gardens are simply beautiful. My daughter enjoyed one whole day of activities; their staffs really know how to make kids happy with fishing, art classes and games from 8 am to 4 pm! Thank you - my daughter loved the activities so much that she absolutely refused to go to town or tour! She can&#39;t stop talking about how she caught 77 fishes in the morning and another 33 in the afternoon. The andung (horse carriage) ride was also quite a novelty for the children. The breakfast is also very good, and I</span><span>&hellip;"
"On first sight the hotel landscape is simply beautiful with views of mount Merapi from the lobby. However after a few days we noticed the &quot;cracks&quot;. My kids used the water slide quite a lot and my son got hurt by some of the paint chips coming off the slide. One of our bedside lights blew up and left our room in complete darkness. It was fixed after 20 minutes and we then noticed the wiring was taped up. The shower taps were hard to turn on &amp; off. The safe wasn&#39;t working when we arrived, but was fixed the same day. The pancake &amp; waffle station went bust as well one morning but manager was very apologetic and did manage to get it fixed.  The hotel just needs a bit more love &amp; attention and a make-over to the rooms, otherwise it&#39;d be fantastic! We managed to relax in between our</span><span>&hellip;"
"discrimination staff. just looking and judging the customer from they look. but the hotel is good, the view is nice, and food nice. please training your staff. just because we use shirt we cant stay at hyatt."
Overall very happy with the hotel and enjoyed our stay there. Would be nicer if our room is not so far to walk to and the noise from the room above us.  Good spread of choices of food at breakfast but the billing is quite confusing.
"Nice and excellences ambiances, green, quiet, nice swimming pool and perfect places for short golf games. Close proximity to Kaliurang and Merapi recreations destinations. Some nice restaurants available near the hotels."
"We love how hyatt treat us...  I Really enjoy with the spa. My son enjoy with the pool, fishing, bcycling, turtle feeding. And my husband really enjoy the ambience  Banyak yang bisa di lakukan disini, jalan2 pagi pun menyenangkan, rasanya hampir semua yang ada di jogja terwakili disini.  Our breakfast and dinner feels great.  "
"Great hotel with great lanscape and pool. My kids are very happy with slide at pool and the fishing pond. Friendly staff, but need improve the check in process. The hotel provide free andong. Overall is ok, will come again."
"Good part:  Luv the resort! beautiful golf-course, garden, pool and overall outdoor layouts.  Breakfast/brunch amazing Indonesian food   Place for improvement: the room layout could be little better and seemed outdated perhaps may be it adopted ethnic style    overall ...if i am visiting Jogja ---i am definitely coming to this resort!"
"The hotel is very nice. Set among quite, secluded grounds. They have a large swimming pool. The only downside of this hotel was that it was some distance away from city center. They run a shuttle bus from the hotel to city center every 2 hours. But with the Yogja traffic being a nightmare, getting to/from the sights of the city took a long time."
"It was our first time to Yogyakarta and we stayed at the executive suite room (we were upgraded from suite room as the hotel was fully booked). It was fantastic.   The staff were very professional and friendly. The room and the whole property are very well maintained. We feel so peaceful just by staying at the hotel. On Saturday evening, there was a local food fair and we love the lay-out a lot (with many little stalls in the garden). The food is super yummy. We love the nasi goreng (fried rice) so much. Overall the food standard is excellent. The local food maintains the original flavor (and trying to make it subtle to fit foreigners&#39; palate).  The hotel is very convenient to Malioboro street (which is the famous shopping street). But when we were going to Prambanan, the</span><span>&hellip;"
"Rooms are HORRIBLY outdated. The lack of maintenance on the property/grounds and facilities are painfully obvious. Because they all try to save money on A/C by using it ONLY when absolutely necessary, there was often a lingering mildew smell throughout the resort.  Don&#39;t get me started on the Jacuzzi in the &#39;SPA&#39;. It looked more like a petridish for a HS science project. The staff was mostly charming as is the case in Indonesia. The food was mediocre at best, but a horrible value for money all things considered."
"I came here for business but it would have been better for a holiday as all I wanted to do was enjoy the pool and the golf course. None the less, doing business and having a conference here is good. The facilities are nice and they look after you very well with regards to catering.   Will come back with the family to make the most of the waterside."
"The Hotel Is very nice and quite with the ambience of golf course, the staff is very charm and helpful, the pool is big and the ambience is very good, they have slides, and basketball ring,,the spa is good too  I will Be back here soon if I go to Yogyakarta"
"Paradise for family with kids (5-12 years) you can do or organize almost everything with them : kids program can be tailored to suit the needs. Pool is big, clean and nice to spend the day or late afternoon. Long jogging track is a plus also the fitness center quite complete"
"Delightful and all too brief a visit to Yogyakarta Hyatt Regency.  Magnificent expansive property, forcing a tranquility and allowing you to forget you were in the middle of a seriously busy city.  Staff were attentive and helpful."
"Sorry, I only decided to review this hotel almost 10 yrs later but it&#39;s a good thing.This hotel had been on my mind. I love the pool and the slide in the pool. Cools me down for the hot Yogyakarta weather."
"The place is very comfortable for family holiday, the staff is friendly, The facilities and playground very fun for children, The food is delicious and complete, The surrounding hotel is comfortable because have many trees and the air is fresh and cool"
"Its nice hotel for family trip with kids. Quite delicious breakfast and nice pool bar. But need some renovations for its furniture in guest room because there&#39;re too much stain, crack, etc on desk, chair."
"We stayed with them for 4 days and it was a great experience starting from the welcome (jasmine garland ) to an grand entry they have overlooking golf course. The check-in was breeze and we were  pleasantly surprised to see they upgraded one level up and since we were celebrating our anniversary they did send a framed picture of us...  The staff at the front desk and the manager was great.  We did our morning run, use the slides (my kids never wanted to come back), they have a very decent sauna at the back. Kids also tried their hand in fishing :)  The breakfast is a large spread and we did eat couple of our meals at the restaurant and it&#39;s priced good.   We had access to club lounge and to my surprise it was fairly loaded. Drinks, hot food, sandwiches etc...  The location is</span><span>&hellip;"
"We had high expectations for this hotel, since some reviewers indicated it was really worthy of its number of stars. We were HIGHLY disappointed right from the start.  Check-in: extremely inefficient. We were not offered the welcome dfrink that others were getting. My child was fussy, yet the young lady kept talking to me and asking me for my credit acrd instead of asking my husband who was not handling the children. I told her to deal with him, but she ignored that.  We arrive in the room, the extra bed is missing. The lady says it is 50 USD (?) extra per night. What??? The extra person was on the reservation. We have to go back down to the reception and discuss to get things resolved. In the mean time, our luggage is not in the room. We wait, we wait... (we had a tour</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed for 3 nights amid a long and crowded weekend in jogja.  A trip with my wife and 2 years old son, we get an upgrade to their junior suite at our second night here. The room was well equipped and in prime condition.. I really like the balcony overlooking mount Merapi, happened to enjoy a misty morning with a cup of coffee there.  One downside that I found during the stay was dining in the room, apparently they did not put the menu inside suite (as usual in other hotels I experienced), they serve the dining menu via web browser. I tried just that, but unfortunately it just did not work for us. But worry not, just a simple phone dial solved it, albeit not knowing the menu.  Overall it was a pleasant stay."
"this hotel have a golf resort, so it&#39;s super greeny and fresh....perfect to take your children strolling around...  the pool was very entertaining especially for children, facilities in this area were complete, the only thing they need to add is LAMP....it&#39;s too dark around....  Food in Restaurant was okay, the variety was quite large with great personal services.  I was Staying in executive suit so I have an access to executive lounge to enjoy an afternoon cocktail. Surprisingly they serve MANY kind of food and beverages including liquor and fresh juice. Nice experience....  Unfortunately, they don&#39;t provide rug in a room and the size of room is quite small. Luckily they have more room than other hotels in Jogja...so i think it&#39;s kinda a thread off...more rooms but smaller</span><span>&hellip;"
"first time stay, check in take long time, needed 20 minutes to enter the room the hotel located not too far from the city, surrounded by greenery, and golf course the facility seems aging, the room clean, internet connection is good very good for family stay, the staffs are friendly"
"overal stay at Hyatt regency feel like at home couse cozy and homy if wanna spending time for drink and cocktail, better book at regency one, have free snack and drink everyday at 17.00 until 19.00 alot of choise for drink..beer, coke and wine..we can drink as we want..and FREE"
The Resort is beautiful.. has a lot facilities and activities. My kids love it. The pool is so big and really entertaining. The foods are great. We can see the beautiful Merapi and surrounded by golf course. Overall is great.. but are you sure your size for King bed is 180x200? 
Not quite 5 star when it comes to food...need to get out to sample other restaurants. Great pool and beautiful grounds. Little spaces tucked away to have drinks or relax. Rooms are quite small especially when you squeeze in an extra bed.
"If you are looking for staycation it is the best place to go to.  They offer great service. Welcome you at the hotel with the Jasmine flower ring!! It smells refreshing.  It is surrounded by greenery but there are plenty of good restaurants and shops nearby.  There are buses arranged to go to Malioborough street (town centre) . Check with hotel staff.   On Saturday/Sunday night, there is a bar near the Golf course and they play great music :)))))  Tips: if you want massage outside of the hotel, call a cab and head to &quot;Kaki Plus&quot; - it is incredibly cheap  and good. Just 10 mins away. It is only SGD7.50 for two hours of foot and shoulder massage. (I tipped the masseur SGD3.00 and I think it made his day ha ha ha)"
Room needs upgrade.  Many equipment are old.  Water from faucet smell and yellowish.  Toilet needs to be replace. Carpet is old and needs to be replaced. Breakfast is excellent and transportation back to airport is very good!
"I had a great stay with you guys. Great selection of breakfast spread with nice pool view. I have also tried the spa on an aromatherapy session, it was absolutely stunning the technic and the attention to detail. I come very often to Jogja and won&#39;t hesitate on making this property my home when there.  Thanks a lot"
"It&#39;s been 8 years i&#39;ve never visit yogyakarta the place that i want to stay in my mind is HYATT REGENCY.. I miss kemangi bistro so much craving for nasi goreng kampung that i ever taste it 8 years ago.. And you know what the taste never change and this is the best Fried rice In TOWN!!!! I still remember ANA the waitress in kemangi bistro and still the same, the way she served me really humble and polite also from the kitchen Mr Ario and Mr. zainal they are still remember me as a CDP really proud of you guys you grown up as a leader in your kitchen, keep them in the company they are Assets in hotel. What a great experience for 1 night stay as really sure i&#39;ll be back soon for stay again in hyatt regency.   Regards,  Gilbert "
"Enjoy the luxury of the hotel with peaceful green scenery representing Yogyakarta&#39;s cultural influence.   Although its a bit far from the city center and malls, but the serene surroundings compensate for the distance. Besides metered taxis and rental cars are easily available and cheap."
We wanted to get away from Singapore for a short break and found Hyatt at Yogyakarta a perfect retreat for relaxing mind and body. The hotel room manager Mr Buddi provided us an upgrade. The room was big and tidy. We were given special treatment because we were vegetarians! Thank you so much for all the staff in the hotel. We felt really looked after.
"Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is a perfect place to escape from routines. You can trust this hotel for their excellent and high quality services.  Come visit on weekend, where you can dine at night market and watch Ramayana Ballet every Saturday night.  "
"We were here last april for a family reunion. The rooms are nice and the view is spectacular. Hotel is surrounded by large gardens with lots of trees, and there is a path where guests can take a walk/jog in the garden. Breakfast offers a wide selection of food and beverage. The only thing i don&#39;t like is the old style bathroom where the shower is in the bathtub, and the tub can be a bit slippery even though there is an anti-slip bathroom mat provided."
"Very nice hotel, with larger garden area and jogging park, and very beautiful golf field. Hyatt Yogyakarta are really different hotel and fantastic place. Good transportation service from/to central Yogyakarta inner city (Malioboro). Very good employee interaction and helpful. Room clean and service are excellent."
"When I saw the pictures of the beautiful landscape and garden of Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, I knew it was the perfect hotel for my family vacation in Jogja last month. The lush, green garden made the hotel ambience perfect.  We were greeted with welcome garland from the lovely staff. This is probably the first time I have ever greeted with garland XD we were escorted to the scenic lobby looking over the golf course and with welcome drink in hand. Since we brought our one-year-old son, the staff offer to handle the check-in process so I can just sit back and relax. So impress with the service.  The rooms in Hyatt Regency was actually quite standard and a bit dated. But, the room was very spacious, and equipped with lots of amenities.  Breakfast was great, too bad I only tried few</span><span>&hellip;"
We stayed two nights as part of a private tour. The hotel has beautiful gardens and an attractive pool area. Lots of seating areas and paths to walk around next to the golf course. We were disappointed that it rained during our stay so couldn&#39;t use these facilities.  The restaurant is large  although it was not very busy during our stay. The food was good and the staff very friendly. Breakfast buffet was adequate. The rooms are a little tired but overall we liked the hotel and it&#39;s quiet location.
"have a great stay at Hyatt Regency Yogya, I will surely comeback to stay here again, the surrounding were great, the landscape were beautiful, all the staff were so polite and caring, the food was good, definitely a great place to have meeting &amp; leisure."
"I found this hotel, is not a new building. But, even so, I feel comfortable here. The view outside the window was green trees and spacious grass field. The food was good, and hotel staff was very helpful. I enjoy my stay here"
"To be clear, this is not a modern hotel with uncomfortable furniture and smug guests. This is on the other hand one of the most majestic and serene places you can find in Yogya. The rooms are clean and well kept, the food is amazing, and the pool(s) are an extraordinary haven of serenity, a real oasis the the bustling city. If you were to remark on the true highlight of the stay, it is undoubtedly the service. Javanese are notorious for their polite and friendly manner, and the crew at the Hyatt will go through every trouble to ensure your stay is brilliant. They clearly are proud of their jobs, their culture, and are always polite and smiling. If you only come to Yogya to stay here throughout (venture out - it is a beautiful city), your visit will have paid off handsomely."
The hotel has great grounds but as much as it was originally a very impressive hotel is appears to left to age ungracefully in that it looks old and needed a good clean.  The food was  disappointing for a 5 star hotel.
Staff are the friendliest and very courteous. they remember your name and greet every time they bump with you. Even the gardeners are very friendly. Check in is very smooth and staff took some time to explain all their amenities and attraction within the Hotel. Room are really spacious and grand enough to be treated like king. The View from room is simply amazing.   Breakfast was so delicious and staff at restaurant also very friendly. The surrounding of this hotel is totally amazing. The View of Mount Merapi at 5.30am will make you speechless. So beautiful and must do in Hyatt Yogyakarta. Take some time to walk around the hotel especially their jogging track. Very well plan and design.   They do have free shuttle to Malioboro street and affordable shuttle service to Airport.</span><span>&hellip;
"rooms tired, needs upgrade. The surrounds are beautiful especially the swimming g pool area. Food is very average, not tasty, definitely not cook with passion, just plain, so disappointing. Breakfast is OK, good choice. Not 5* hotel in my books."
"Probably one of the best properties in Jogjya and a great place to start your exploration of the rich history of the region, from ancient Buddhist and Hindu temples to the stunning Mount Merapi, the most active volcano in Indonesia, the Hyatt is a great property with excellent service that makes you feel very welcome every time you step into the lobby. Rooms are very nice, a bit dated, but very well kept and comfortable. The two things that really make this property stand out are the fantastic staff and the property which has lots of green spaces, a great pool with a water slide, and as I mentioned, stunning views of Merapi!"
"Everything awesome, from service to breakfast. Come here couple times.but i never stay here. Mostly meeting my family or friends. So this is my first personal visit. If you want take the shuttle you need to book earlier, especially from malioboro to the hotel at 9:00 pm.  But the check in and check out seriously taking time about 15-30 minutes. Will be better if it faster.   + Cleanliness (5) + Service (5) + breakfast (5) + Facilities (5) "
"I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The staff was friendly and helpful, but the hotel room needed a make-over. The pool was not cleaned and partially not functional. Due to a wedding, we could not eat in the inside main restaurant, but had to eat at Bogey‚Äôs Teras restaurant. The staff there was completely clueless and ignorant towards our needs. The menu they offered to us consisted only of unhealthy and greasy finger food, for someone to bring us a menu took 20 minutes and for our drinks we had to wait another 15 minutes. The staff there didn&#39;t seem to care."
"Love everything about the hotel especially the garden, the swimming pool and the service. Even though it is located not in the center heart of Yogya but it is worth it. üòô They offers so many things to do in the hotel"
"Nice Hotel, And Beautiful Hotel with Golf Course...  I was there with all my friend from many city in Indonesia for the accommodation of our Club Touring.  The Breakfast is Superb, with many delicious choices"
"The title summarizes the hotel.  Two thumbs up for hotel service! All staff were responsive and friendly. We asked for several things during our 3-night stay and they responded quickly.  We stayed in deluxe room. It was dated and small but clean and nice with a balcony.   We ordered fried rice &amp; mixed fruit once via room service. It was delivered nicely as the fruit was beautifully arranged.  The location is a bit far from city center but good if you go north (Borobudur, Merapi, Kaliurang). The hotel provide free shuttle bus to Malioboro street. Taking taxi is easy as they are standby in hotel parking area.  Kids would love to stay in this hotel as they have swimming pool with a slide, kids club and fish pond.  "
"I booked this hotel through Agoda last December and I was able to get a room for $69. Since we planned to bring our helpers with us, I got interconnecting rooms.   The welcome party of the hotel were great. There was also security checks each time you go in the hotel.   We get a lanyard of Sampaguita as a welcome from the hotel plus drinks. The check in was a breeze. The hotel is about 30 minutes from the train station.   Hotel grounds were beautiful! Mini stupas all over with several koi ponds. Their pools are well maintained. They have golf courses and bikes for you to borrow.   Rooms were average sized. It has complete amenities. Bottled water are replenished each time. Welcome fruits are available when we first arrived. There are coffee and tea facilities, bathrobes, iron</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed in Hyatt for 5D4N with my family. I was able to book this hotel through Agoda. My expectations were met.   Hotel grounds were nice, ambience is great and the welcoming committee at Hyatt was also good. I did not have any problem with the check in. It was a breeze.   They have a wide variety of choices for breakfast. The only thing that they don&#39;t serve is bacon.   There&#39;s a tour desk inside the hotel, so you can book your Borobudur or Prambanan tour with them. You have to book your Malioboro trip ahead of time - as this is very popular.  The Andong Village tour is a horse ride tour that will let you tour the area around the hotel. Nothing much to see, except for houses, hotels and schools around Hyatt."
"Top of mind for family staycation in Jogja. I stay with my toddler (2yo) and staying in Hyatt especially pool and garden, very good for toddler who actively running. Location also nice, far from noise and the facilities are awesome. Yet nice staffs, but the minus is the room interior is so average."
"very pleasant stay here because it is away from the crowds, and very precise strategic place to spend the holiday weekend with family. staff very friendly and helpful. The hotel also provides a bus to drop / pick us into the city center. children can play on the play ground and swimming pool."
Simply the best hotel in Jogja. Great landscape for outdoors. Hotel ambient is amazing. The food is healthy and tasty. The staff is attentive and helpful and friendly. The kids love the ambient and landscape too.
"Stay for a night in the club room feels not enough for our family... we love the pool... my son and his father love the slide and the waterfalls. there&#39;s kids fishing ponds, outbond area, jogging track, spa, bar and restaurant. The hotel also near to golfing area Lots of tree that makes the ambiance so nice, beautifull and relaxe "
The hotel is a great base for Yogyakarta sightseeing as its close to the airport and Borobudur and you can miss the worst of the traffic. But the service is ropey. Room service takes forever and the mains arrive cold. Pool service is soooooo slow. The running path around the hotel is beautiful but not well signposted and in the rainy season the path is so slippery you can&#39;t run fast. If you use the gym instead it may not be clean. Our rooms were connecting as we requested but between our arrival and having both rooms and our two bags took more than 3 hours and 2 trips to the front desk to find out what the delay was. Not what you want after an inbound flight. 
"This was the  most relaxing, enjoyable stay I&#39;ve had at any Hyatt in a long time. From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and nothing was too much to ask. Our room was very adequate, an extra bed added for our son. Spacious bathroom with all the amenities you&#39;d expect.   The hotel grounds are stunning and lush. The 2km running track was great, as was the 18 hole golf course, which my husband and son used often. The spa had a jucuzzi as well as a sauna, which was complimentary with any treatment.   For a very reasonable upgrade you can enjoy cocktails and nibbles each night. There are several places to eat on the premises and if you are fortunate enough to be there over a weekend there is themed cultural dining, including entertainment. The quality of food and variety</span><span>&hellip;"
"You need to stay at this hotel if you&#39;re looking for excellent facilities especially when travelling with kids. They have kids club and free delman rides, bike rental, great pools &amp; garden. You need to ensure the availability of non smoking room when it is your very basic needs. Bedroom soundproof needs improvement, Breakfast menu has a lot of choice but need variety. Even though the room is outdated, it is very clean.  Excellent hotel staff."
Wide country setting and located near the city center. Hotel provides excellent transportation services to historic sites like Borobudur and Prambanan. Restaurants provides traditional Indonesian and Wester cuisines.
Stayed here for 6 nights with my wife. We had a great time. Found entire staff very friendly and ready to assist. Excellent food. Amazing pools. There is 9 hole golf course. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to friends and family. 
"The hotel staff ruined the special weekend I had planned to celebrate my friend&#39;s birthday. The hotel is gorgeous. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is great. But what sets a hotel apart from other hotels is the service.  We were treated HORRIBLY at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. First, when we arrived (after a long day on the road to Borobodur), we were greeted with snobbery despite having a Club room. During a 2 night stay, multiple staff members questioned our legitimacy as guests... pretty much every time we came or went we were rudely asked what we were doing there.   Second, although I had made a booking for 3 people in a room, they surprised me with an extra bed fee that was not on my reservation. I agreed to pay the fee without much fuss though I was disappointed that</span><span>&hellip;"
"The Hyatt Regency is a great, family friendly hotel at the heart of Yogyakarta. The hotel has a wonderful pool (with a great water slide) and has a magnificent golf course.  The hotel also offers a free, twenty-minute tour of a neighboring village. You will be picked up on a horse carriage and have the opportunity to explore a local, residential area. I highly recommend it. The diamond lounge is absolutely wonderful. It serves a great breakfast and dinner. The food is great and there is a great variety. However, several faults of the hotel include the language ability of the staff and the free breakfast. Though the service and effort was outstanding, it was a little hard to understand the English of the staff and I hope that can improve. The free breakfast, offered a great</span><span>&hellip;"
"A lot of activity for whole family. We stay here for 4D3N. Nice gardening and landscape. We get complementary welcome drinks upon arrival, Andong Village Tour and free return shuttle to Malioboro Street which is the city center of Yogyakarta. Breakfast can be improve on variety for each days. Overall stay is great. Thank you to friendly staff. Will stay here again."
"Great running track. Beautifully landscaped gardens. Wifi works fine. Food average. Room are a little old eg no shower cubicle, only a bathtub. But well maintained and everything works fine. Well worth coming out of the centre for.  Recommend it.  "
"Stay in a hotel with 22 hectare area with 9 hole golf course inside the hotel complex with a superb panoramic view is an experience, and enjoy swimming pool with a lot of miniature statue spread all over the place, incredible, Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, Indonesia."
We usually stay here for a night when we Land from the UK. The Jet Lag is terrible so this place serves us well in recovery. Great Pool area to relax. Lovely Rooms. It is reasonably priced also.   Stayed here December 2015
"This hotel surprised us pleasantly in more ways than one. While the design of the suite was not particularly memorable, it was comfortable and roomy enough for a family of four.    What we loved was the lush landscape, the swimming pools (one of which had an awesome slide) and the many activities for kids. You could bike, jog or golf. There was a little pond for kids to try their hand at fishing, and an aviary where they could feed the birds.  Food was reasonably good and the complimentary shuttle to the city center added to its exceptional value.  Great choice for family with young kids."
I stayed for 2 nights and booked 4 rooms with my guests. I must say we all enjoyed the stay in the hotel. I know the hotel is one of the older establishment in Yogya but the facilities and rooms are well maintained. The staff is friendly and rooms are comfortable. Wifi works good! I would say maybe the manager needs to look at the staff at the restaurant and lounge service as they tend to be quiet slow. We had to wait long to get some drinks.
"This was my second stay at this hotel. First impression was excellent that it made me want to come back. Great swimming pools and beautiful garden(s).  Definitely a nice hotel for R &amp; R. The location is a little far from the city centre, but hey who needs to spend time outside this beautiful hotel. There are some restaurants nearby and mini markets are also within walking distance."
"We celebrated Christmas at the Hyatt Regency for two nights while visiting Borobudur in Yogyakarta and it was a wonderful stay! Great service, beautiful landscape, and very comfortable room (the spa was okay). The view from our room was spectucular. Overall, it was exceptional value. Highly recommended!"
"We have booked a room at this hotel and we were very happy. So gorgeous beautiful hotel, surrounded with enormous huge grounds, including golf area and with large outdoor multi-level swimming pool. Hotel is located just outside the city centre. Actually quests don‚Äôt need to worry, hotel is providing free shuttle bus all day, including late return.  Room was standard 4-5 star hotel room, without any special design. Breakfast was quite good with a variety of choice, Asian, European and local specialities, also lots of fruits and snacks.  The staff were all very friendly, extremely helpful and ready to fulfil all your wishes.  Especially we want to say very big thank you to Guest Relation Manager, Mr. HERWAN JOKO SANTOSO. He made our stay incredibly unforgettable. This man really</span><span>&hellip;"
A top notch hotel with excellent services and Borobudur-esque style. Rooms are okay with lots of outdoor activities option e.g. jogging or golf. It would be a perfect 5-star if only it has better breakfast menu.
"we stayed with our kids for 3 nights, it was an exceptional experiences. we just love every aspects of the hotel. the staffs are very warm and helpful. the breakfast choices are abundant,  and the best thing is the surrounding area is absolutely amazing."
"This hotel was a great surprise. Rooms are big and nice, even though a bit old. But the area is great and green. Nice golf course and jogging track, great swimming pool, a pond were kids can fish .... Breakfast is very nice. Excellent service. All this for a low price I got on Booking. Would go back there for sure."
"We had a weekend stay here in January, very nice landscape with good garden and golf course. Breakfast was excellent, featuring local dishes. The room was not so big but comfortable and clean. The service was good, very friendly people."
"This is a very good hotel, very friendly staff combine with hospitality yogyakarta culture. The foods is so delicious and a lot of foods option. But unfortunately the bicycle facility can&#39;t use surround the the golf field.   I wish that I would stay there in the next vacation or trip."
"We stayed here for 2 night on a quick trip from Bali.  The rooms are in major need of an upgrade, otherwise it was a pleasant stay.  We spent a couple of hours by the pool on our first day and enjoyed the novelty of the waterslide. Once it starts to get dark the mosquitos take over pretty quickly, so make sure you have repellant with you if you&#39;re going to stay outside.  We had dinner on 1 night and thought the meals were nice, we chose to order local food which we enjoyed.  The ground are lovely and give it a real resort feel, which you need as the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. It was a good base for sightseeing and the hotel offer a shuttle service in to the city at night, which we used.  We had an issue with our return flights and the lady in the business centre was</span><span>&hellip;"
"Hyatt jogja is  a nice property situated in the outskirts of jogja.Firstly about the property ,The entrance lobby is beautiful with ponds and beautiful architecture . it has a beautiful pool meandering like a river .it also has a small  baby pool  for toddlers.The check in  process took unusually long time though the desk was not crowded  .Room size was decent with golf and garden view .The staff is courteous but bit slow .Breakfast spread is ok ,not a great spread for vegetarians .over all a nice hotel to stay in jogja would surely recommend "
"The hotel property, the grounds, the pool, the adjoining golf course, the spa, everything is there, it just falls shot on the critical areas to jump two stars ahead.   The check in and out process is as one guest mentioned, stressed at &quot;peak&quot; times, meaning more than 3 guests at the counter. The food and restaurant is really below par. Only one restaurant and it is pretty sub par for International hotel, when u consider that all your effort in food service is concentrated in one delivery.    Rooms are really really in need of updating, although comfy beds and linens.   Staff are friendly, although all seemingly long timers, or Trainees, making me think there is a management issue here.   Sadly though, this is the best u can do outside the hustle bustle of city center. Another</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel is quite soothing after a hectic day of sightseeing in the city and its outskirts. The staff are attentive although slightly harassed at peak check-in hours, rooms slightly dated but tasteful and well-maintained, and the grounds (plus pool) provide a nice contrast with the urban areas outside. If one has to find fault with the place, I&#39;d say the bathroom tubs can be quite slippery and deserves a renovation, but it&#39;s a minor point. "
Really enjoyed my stay at this Hotel. It&#39;s beautifully decorated with stunning garden view and pool. Too bad I don&#39;t have time to try the pool. Nothing special about the room but all seem just fine. Breakfast has excellent taste with a lot of variety. Delicious lunch buffet with all the local cuisine.  Will definitely back to this Hotel!
"A year ago, we spent four days in this beautiful hotel. We enjoyed very much our stay there; the hotel is beautifully decorated rigth in the middle of the ground and stunning gardens. Great food for breakfast and excellent afternoon brunch made our stay unforgettable. Fully recomended !!"
"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Yogya, the hotel is beautifully decorated and the grounds and gardens were stunning. Pity I didn&#39;t bring my golf clubs but surely I could have borrowed or hired some locally. We stayed with our two children of 4 and 7 in a club room with an extra bed for our 7 yr old and our four year old in between us in the large kingsize bed.   The main pool was amazing with a very long and exciting water slide, our kids hated leaving and made a lot of friends in and around the pool. There is also a pole across one pool for a &#39;pillow fight&#39; which was a great laugh.  The room is okay, nothing special but  functional, quiet and tidy. Food was okay at the cafe and we very much enjoyed a Javanese evening with a beautiful dance show and delicious buffet</span><span>&hellip;"
"Hyatt Jogya lives up to to its reputation. Definitely worth spending the extra dollar on.   We stayed for 5very balmy days and it was beautifully refreshing! Their staff very courteous, helpful and always pleasantly engaging. E.g. We had an early early mrng trip out and since our rooms were paid for w bfast, they prepared takeaway bfast boxes at 4am for us. Very thoughtful!  Hotel has beautiful foyer and gardens that one can spend time wandering about. Swimming area is quite wide and also nicely done up amongst the greenery.   The hotel has a golf course. This made the hotel seem to be enveloped in a green blanket. Very calming.  They also house a spa (must try!), salon, gym, a clinic, bar facing the golf course and a dining area under a large tree. Only drawback, their rooms</span><span>&hellip;"
"One of the unexpected challenges of visiting Jogja these days is the city&#39;s increasingly gridlocked traffic. Which could be a problem if you plan to visit both Borobudur and Prambanan temples on, say, a weekend trip. This hotel can save a few hours vacation time on such a visit, by our estimates. It has both easy access to the main road going north to Borobudur, as well as the ring road which links to Prambanan east of the city. So either way you will go around, not through Jogja. Luxuriate in the knowlegde that you&#39;re ahead of 90% of visitors, trafically speaking. While the latecomers remain caged in their minibuses amidst Borobudur&#39;s horrendous weekend parking armageddon, you could be well on your way downtown for a quick visit. Even if you fail to visit either temple, there&#39;s</span><span>&hellip;"
The view is very beautifull. Golf course is very big. Nice pool. There is pool for child. Free for rent bicycle &amp; andong. Good breakfast. 3 person breakfast (2 adult &amp; 1 child). Poor wifi. Corporate rate price is good. Good staff. Thanks.
"I booked a non smoking standard room. When we first entered the room, somehow the room smells like cigarette smoke. I complained to the font desk and to have the room checked and cleaned. As a result, the Assistant manager in charge came to my room and offered me to move to a different room. Surprisingly, they offered a better room (Deluxe) with no additional charges. I love the way the staff treated me as a dissapointed customer"
"Located a 10-min drive out of town, the Hyatt Regency is the grand old resort of Jogja.  The rooms are dated and small, but the grounds are expansive and the resort-style pool (with water slide) is excellent.    Meals were generally OK, but the best Indonesian food is definitely to be found outside.  The breakfast spread was good, but first-time visitors to Indonesia should note it&#39;s pork-free.  This hotel is facing increasing competition from newer, better located and appointed hotels, including The Phoenix.  If you stay, be sure to walk 50m down the road for coffee and lunch at Epic Coffee.  Fantastic coffee in great surrounds."
"Stayed two nights in February - rooms are very clean (if a little dated) and the service is efficient and friendly. We had a couple of problems with our booking (room rate, room type and activities), however management sorted these out in a very sympathetic and helpful manner. The grounds of the property are magnificent, and it was a relaxing base for our journies to Merapi, Borabudur and Prambanan.  Overall, a fantastic stay!"
"Huge grounds, with a botanical garden feel make this place feel special. Plenty of activities for children (horse drawn cart, swimming and more).  Breakfast fairly average, and the hotel is a fair way away from the centre of the city, but if you want a quiet place this is a great choice.  Rooms are fairly old, but well cared for. Good value overall, and we enjoyed the stay."
"all staffs are very professional , cooperative and caring . Made my vacation with family memorable . Facilities such as book cab for trip are easily accessible . Would definitely recommend all my friends ."
We went for two night stay here. My daughters enjoyed the hotel very much. They like swimming especially the slide pool. The breakfast was great with lots of choices for kids and adult. I just didn&#39;t knew that there are a golf course next to the hotel. I will sure comeback to stay and play golf!
"I stay here in between Xmas-New year holiday 2015. I&#39;ve been here about eight years ago, and as I remembered nothing special about this hotel, especially the room design was so simple and a bit dull. While at that time I came for work purposes, this time was for holiday and have a chance to explore the whole facilities. And it was totally different experience. The room was the same, but indeed we didn&#39;t need to spend much time there while resort is next to our door. I enjoy stroll along at the backyard, mesmerize by its golf course plus Merapi mountain as background. Amazing....Jogging track and bike available to explore this view. The traditional design with becak and old fashioned bike and gamelan sound are giving different touch - and yes confirming your feeling that you are</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed for 4 nights and experienced excellent service, great SPA, well prepared diverse breakfast,a nice swimming pool, biking tour of 3 hours through the rice fields, special well done evening programmes."
"My wife, son (7 months) and I stayed for two nights. Very nice and attentive staff. I was pleasantly surprised by the greeting by name on arrival and Budi, the head of guest relations immediately there to assist. We went into Jl Malioboro for a bit of shopping and then hopped on the rickshaw&#39;s for a tour. We requested to stop by a traditional hand made puppet maker to buy two and then went on to buy some batik. All very nice.   Day two my wife and I woke up early to go on the bike ride. Budi helped organize and came with us. There are two options, either bike from the hotel where you&#39;ll see a bit of paddy fields or have them drive you up. We were the only ones so transport was a bit more expensive but I highly recommend doing it. We thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this morning</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel has a very good outside view, good service and average breakfast. The location is a bit far away from the downtown. The service is very good but if you are looking for a 5 start service and guests  you have to choose other options. The room are clean but old furniture and basic stuffs, don&#39;t expect more.... Good price for what you get."
"stayed in this lovely hotel for 3 days, always love its beauty and the friendly staff...  hyatt jogja is huge, and the landscape is never boring.. So if you want to enjoy serenity, this place is the best to go to   i travel solo to explore jogja, and spend most of time relaxing in the hotel üòÑ the architecture, the landscape, the spa, the jogging track, the pool... all were just awesome!! "
"PRO: landscaped gardens, pool, fitness center, cocktail lounge, wonderful breakfast buffet - and the excellent service of the staff. CON:  Outdated rooms, inconsistent air con, disappointing a la carte menu."
"Good setting with a lot of greenery, excellent service and peaceful environment. We enjoyed our stay. being vegetarians, the Chef accommodated our preferences and the quality of food was very good. Will definitely choose Hyatt for next trip."
"Really Loved staying at this hotel. Overall, this is a great place to stay and we are very keen to come back. In our bathroom, it just need some improvement, especially the water taps, leaking. Also, need some attention on the 2nd fl men&#39;s toilet. The toilet shower/bidet spray that I used was broken. So need to be inspected regularly. Furthermore, room actually was good and clean beds but not sound-proof though. I stay in a room with a connecting door. I can hear the sound/people talking from the next room loud and clear. It was very annoying and disturbing during my sleeping time."
"Its a ver very nice hotel with big pool, lovely garden, and golf range.. You will be so comfort to stay here over your nite. The breakfast has so many kind menus. This hotel is so recomended for you with your family or couple. Romantic atmosphire you can get here. "
"We stayed in the Regency Club.  It was worth the extra.  It meant that we could have a quiet, relaxing breakfast when we wanted with the chef cooking eggs to order.  In the evening the drinks and canap√©s were equally pleasant.  The pool and other facilities were great.  We can recommend the hotel&#39;s organised bike ride."
"Very special for its beautiful green environment. Good access to downtown, airport and the various targets around Yogyakarta. Reception remembers you, and whenever possible, will find you a room with terrace (there are plenty). Resting space for drivers. A pity if we only stay here for a short business trip ‚Äì next time should spend a holiday here."
I stayed with my husband and kids ages 8 and 2 for 5 days.  We all loved this place!  My 8 year old spent hours at the fishing pond and my younger son loved the pools and water slide.  The staff were very nice and the breakfast was a great variety of Western and Indonesian food.
This is a beautiful hotel in every sense and suitable for anyone from short business stay to a lengthy family holiday. This hotel represents great value for a 5 star Hotel-Resort and would cost double or more in a larger city.
"Not normally a fan of big hotel resorts, I fell in love with the photos of the Grand Hyatt Yogyakarta and decided to stay on my recent visit.  No disappointment here - from the moment the car drove through the entrance the beauty of the grounds could be seen.   Check in was seamless, we were greeted with a welcome drink and then transferred to our room.  The room itself was fine - we opted for a deluxe room with balcony.  The bathrooms are &quot;tired&quot; and probably do need to be renovated, however for me the views of the stunning pool and surrounds compensated for this.   Photos cannot capture the character of the pool as there are several areas, linked together via bridges as well as the water slide based on the Borobudur theme.   After a day in the heat of Yogyakarta exploring</span><span>&hellip;"
"comfort hotel for spending your time in yogyakarta. good landscape, serve, thre are many beautiful place to relaxing your time.. excellent rate for everyone. and good for restaurant and bar, pool, and fitness centre, garden, and golf. very large garden"
"We had a relaxing stay at Hyatt for 3 nights after busy days in Jakarta.  As many Indonesian, Staff is friendly and polite.  At Hyatt, staff is also professional.  We enjoyed the massage and tour serviced through the hotel.  Great foods.  Beautiful ground and pools."
"I give point 4 of 5 about room. Not so special but ok, especially what we can see from our windows room hotel facility : 5 of 5, fantastic, you can get everything there :). Good view, pool with waterpark, good restaurant, golf field, and others Food : 5 of 5 for their buffet. Found international and traditional food with good taste Location : If we just want to enjoy the hotel , it is quite ok and also my advise to you. But access to hotel bid jump especially in traffic season and holiday season"
"near merapi volcano and north outer ring road, easy access to the city, and there&#39;s many restaurant surrounding the hotel. you can get free drink (beer/wine), and snack in the afterrnoon if you stay in hyatt regency room. they have many facilities such as big pool with slide, jogging track, and fitness centre."
"my family and i really enjoy stay there. wish cold go back there this year and stay more longer than the last time... really a great place and fully activities .... my kids enjoy to to a lot activities, but too bad they couldnot do everything cause the short of time we had."
I like this hotel because the decor is strongly influenced by traditional Javanese art. The hotel is also nice and cozy with a big swimming pool. The location is very convenient as it has a few small surrounding shops and eateries.
"Stayed 4 nights in a Club Room. Friendly Club staff, good evening drinks and snacks. Nice afternoon coffees and soft drinks, good breakfast too. Prices are amazing for a nice hotel like this. Food and beverage prices, while expensive for local standards, were cheap enough to encourage me to eat here (I rarely do that!). Quality was very good.  What I loved the most here was the pool! Beautiful, huge, interesting landscape.  Gym is the only thing that could be improved--- it&#39;s tiny, and there is no Wifi that works, so I couldn&#39;t listen to my music either. Not enough weights or cardio machines for a good workout, though for something light it&#39;s OK.  Location is good, about an hour to Borobodur and 30 minutes to Prambanan, and there is a shuttle a few times a day to the city</span><span>&hellip;"
"We (my husband, my daughter 2yo and i) stayed 3 days 2 night at room 635 in standard room. Complete amenities and room facilities. First night went well but the next day, when we connected usb to the television then the power gone off. We call the room helper, then the staff changed the broken tv with the new one. We really grateful with their services. Btw, they gave us 2 boxes of snack and candies for that problem.. Thanks btw.. hehehe..  The public facilities itself had spacious garden, with spacious pool. my daughter and i tried once at the pool but not for long cause it crowd. But its great experience and good facilities though..  Sorry can&#39;t share our photo. :D  Very good hotel.. Very Recommend for next stay."
"The outdoor garden, golf course and swimming pool are very nice and beautiful, The foods were served with a very varied from western to the local traditional food. All very delicious...The staff very friendly, however some house keeping must be maintained during peak season with full occupancy"
As it was my first time to yogyakarta my friends and i had decided to stay in the hyatt regency . It was definitely a good choice as the hotel was very nice and well maintained . Lots of restaurants and coffee shops within 5 min around the hotel area. We were greeted by the hotel staff with flowers and some fruit punch .   1.The downside about my stay was that the receptionist Mr. Rosso had told us that only 1 room was ready for us when it was 12 oclock noon eventhough we have booked 2 because the hotel was fully booked and that the other room would be ready by 2pm.  2. At 2pm we had gone to the receptionist to ask for pur roome key by another receptionist and it was quickly given to us. As we reached our room we saw 3 cleaning service crew trying to open the door a few times</span><span>&hellip;
"I would have loved to  stay for more than the three nights only if i knew how great Hyatt was going to be. It was my first time in Indonesia...the service all over in Jogja was fabulous and I believe I made an excellent choice by making Hyatt the base for exploring Central Java even though it&#39;s on the outskirts of Jogja. Everything superceded my expectations due to the great service provided by the hotel staff. Rooms were well appointed with all amneties and nice views of the pool except for the bathroom. Excellent range of breakfast, lunch was fabulous and so was a special seafood buffet in the night with live music. A very good spa and foot reflexology was fab! The tours organised by the hotel was amazing and the tour guides gave a great introduction to the rich Indonesian</span><span>&hellip;"
This trip is my second stay at Hyatt Regency hotel which the hotel is well maintained. it has friendly and helpful staff. There are many kind of food for breakfast. I will recommend it to my business friend and relative. The rate is very valuable. All member of my family very enjoy staying there. Thanks Hyatt Regency Yoyakarta
"Hi there   I&#39;m really fall in love with this hotel,  this hotel is quite and has remarkable view, you can enjoy mount merapi from your balcony.   The front office service is superb, fast and friendly, they assist us with care and great personal touch.   I stayed for 2 nights in Deluxe Balcony Room, the room are spacious, linen are clean and all facilities are available as listed. My daughter enjoy it very much,  she said: &quot;Hotel nya enak ya Papa, aku mau kesini lagi&quot;.   Breakfast is one of the good experience (all food are delicious) , but cannot compare with Shangri-la Jakarta.   Overall this hotel is perfect for family vacation, but it&#39;s rather far from Jalan  malioboro Yogyakarta,  but is okay if you seek more comfort and calm situations.   Thank you   Keep up the good work"
"Room was ok, location &amp; facility was good especially when you stay for holiday with kids. Small problem was can&#39;t flush the toilet but solve directly, sadly driving range were closed and replace by 9 hole golf range. Too bad didn&#39;t bring complet golf set"
"This hotel is really recommended to stay in Yogyakarta. Very cozy place, nice view and excellent service. The hotel condition is well maintained and all the prices are very reasonable. Absolutely will stay here again."
"this was a perfect hotel from which to explore borobodur in terms of comfort and price. the rooms were just average - basic and no-frills. ours had unimaginative floor tiles that made the rooms feel stark and unwelcoming. but the hotel in general was very welcoming with pretty common areas - reception, pool, restaurant by the pool, and best of all (if you book club rooms) the club lounge. breakfast in the restaurant by the pool was delightful - quite a spread and in a nice setting."
We were spoiled with the panoramic view of Mt Merapi during sunrise. A morning walk or jog around the lavish garden around the golf course can really set your mood for a nice day ahead.  Bike tour organized by the hotel is a must to do while you were there. We were disappointed with the andong tour as the route was merely around the  busy street with full of housing complex behind the hotel without the glimpse of the rice field or nature.
"- my complaints were the smelly robe and itchy chair in the room - bed is average, could be updated to better for hotel in this class - good quality food, just average taste - nice staffs and services - room is clean and silent - swimming pool water is not clear, but didn&#39;t make me itchy"
Stayed there in August 2015. Club rooms were fantastic. The food was repetitive but the service made up for the dullness of repetitions. Breakfast was scrumptious. The pools were an experience and you must try the free horse cart ride. Best room service his eyes ever Experienced.  They provide nicely packed picnic boxes for to go which are life savers when you want good quality food 
"This is a fabulous resort-like setting with several open spaces, gardens, and a winding rive-like pool. Situated next to the golf course the hotel is quiet, has well-appointed rooms, great food and very attentive and friendly personnel. I only had two days for a business trip and the place made it all worth it! "
"We were recommended to stay here and were not disappointed‚Ä¶the grounds and the pool were lovely and just what we needed after tripping around Borobudur and Prambanan. It is a fairly big hotel but the lovely Indonesian staff make you feel at home immediately. Excellent value for money. The food in the hotel is good, particularly the breakfast but do try the restaurant next next door as well - Sasanti - we had a great meal there."
"Fantastic surrounding with a lot of old trees, the hotel is located next to a small golf course. Nice pools with slides for kids. Friendly and competent staff. Rooms are bit small and especially bathrooms are a bit out of date. Mattress and pillows are too hard. Sleeping experience is better in Aston or Eastparc hotel. Breakfast is OK, a bit more of Western food should be available.  We booked two rooms for five days, unfortunately no baby cot was available during our stay. There are some kids activities like fishing and the pool of course, but what is missing is a indoor or outdoor playground. There is a kids club, but only very few places are available. From a family hotel I would expect more for kids."
"Very large parks surround this temple-like structure of a hotel. Green, peaceful, immersive with nature with a lot of outdoor places and verandas.  Great choices of local food being served in the menu and in buffets over the weekends. Dance shows every weekend to add to the local immersion.  All in very reasonable price. Granted, this isn&#39;t too close to city center, but I&#39;ve been to Jogja many times and Hyatt Regency is hands down my number one choice."
"The only reason i didnt put terrible for this hotel is the location and the ambience. The rest are horrible, the service at the restaurant that make me wait an hour for a nasi gorenhlg, unfriendly frontdesk that doesnt want ro help me to put my luggage at the concierge... really is an awfull hotel to be honest, dont know why people give good rated. I wont recommend this hotel if  you stay at yogyakarta.   Adhit."
"The Green, Scenery, Ambiance, and Tranquility are really great &amp; awesome - an anesthetic to forget this heavy polluted earth. The Cleanliness is excellent. The Pool is so nice. But the taste &amp; varieties of the Food should be better."
"I expected a 5 stars facilities, but very disappointed. Lobby was too smelly with lemongrass aroma, bathroom was outdated and stained, toilet was leaked, food was terribly overcooked. Nothing special other than nice garden"
"The family stayed here for three nights in three Regency Club rooms. Our rooms were located right outside the club lounge. Its convenient of course, but you will need to put up with the human traffic outside your rooms. The staff tends to be loud too, chatting among themselves. Rooms are old but still ok. Housekeeping was all right although they did not replenish all the toiletries used the previous day. F&amp;B at the lounge was above average with a wide variety both at breakfast and evening cocktail. We stayed during the Dec year end holiday season and the hotel was packed!  Did not use the pool at all for this reason. The other reason was the water looked a little murky. Tried the breakfast at the bistro and it was very crowded, food/glasses were not replenished quick enough. To</span><span>&hellip;"
"friendly and  helpfull staff, spa was very good, quality and variety of food was also very good. All the attractions , shopping malls were nearby  Playing golf early in the morning with nice and helpfull caddies. Conci√´rge and shuttle well provided."
"Very Nice Hotel with huge garden area, nice pool, friendly staff and good food. Good hotel to stay if you bring family or friend. Hotel with golf yard. The swimming pool was very nice my children love it. We already planned to stay for next summer holiday."
"hyatt jogyakarta ...miss u, like back home parents in the village,comportable,quiet,full of inspiration and full color.With natural shades,cool with clean air and healthy,her friendly staff.the food was super tasty and nutritious.I love hyatt regency jogyakarta.miss u"
"The staff were the best part of the hotel and they really like to chat with you so this hotel was really good for a single traveler. Since hotel was not so crowded it was very possible to get individual attentions often. There was some misunderstanding with communications with some of the spa staff but they all seem genuine for the service for the most part. The biggest draw was the cleaness of the hotel. While the room is quite clean, the hallway and many parts of the hotel weren&#39;t well maintained and cleaned. For example, the spa facility was really far away and outsiders were using and not so clean for a 5 star hotel. Maybe 1 star level cleanness. Also, the swimming pool was too small and not so clean for swimming. This hotel is built next to a golf course and this serves</span><span>&hellip;"
"Great hotel.  At 18 years old, it is aging with dignity with lovely rooms, excellent service and stunning grounds.  The amenities are very atmospheric,  a wonderful place to enjoy in the craziness of Jogjakarta.  We upgraded for a small fee to lounge access with breakfast and evening cocktails and found it good value.   If you want to be in the centre of town though, this is about 15 minutes in a cab.  Health club (sauna) is however old and tired so if you&#39;re into that, this is disappointing - however, we weren&#39;t bothered as everything else is beautiful.  Avoid the minibar though - stupid prices!  Excited to visit again soon! "
"Stay 2 night at this hotel, the staf was very polite and helpful.  The director of the rooms even personally invites us to join a cycling tour the next morning from merapi to the hotel for free.   The room is a little old, but it&#39;s very comfortable and clean. Even though we have some problem with the  toilet flush, the engineer come quickly to fix that problem.   Our room is on the first floor and has direct access to the garden.  The children were very happy to slip right to the pool just a few meter in front of our rooms.   The pools are magnificent, there are sliding, pillow fight, and basket ball to be play.   They even have a ping pong table for us to play.   My wife have fun also jogging around the hotel along the jogging track provided.  We discovered they have some</span><span>&hellip;"
"Great service, good food and comfortable rooms. The gardens, swimming pools and golf course surrounding the hotel provide an oasis of green - great for relaxing after a day travelling. Staff always ready to help. Excellent value."
This hotel serves clean rooms and kind staffs. And the most good thing I satisfied with was botanic garden and fonds. But the most bad thing I disappointed was foods and beverages at breakfast and dinner.  They were boring menu and not good tastes.  
"Basically Hyatt Regency Hotel is really impressive. The building is very unique and relaxing, especially the central Joglo Lounge Lobby with it&#39;s exotic scenery. The room was clean and cozy and foods was delicious. If you stay with the famliy, the swimming pool will be a very good place to spend some quality time. At evening you can also hang out at Bogey&#39;s Caffee for some drink and live music with very warm home band while enjoying the view of 9 holes golf course beside you."
"I really liked this hotel, the grounds were amazing.  Only reason I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars was because I felt the rooms were a little dated.  They had a local traditional ballet night along with local foods.  Worth doing!"
"The service was excellent, more than expected. Amazing huge pool, my children really love it . Wide variety food at breakfast. Room was superclean and spacious. Taxi just in front of the hotel.. Take a short free ride with &quot;delman&quot;..best experience ever with family."
Recommended  and my first time in  and best stay in Jogjakarta. Got in the Hotel after heavy rain. Got checked in quickly. Presented with flowers and luggage were taken care for. I shall definitely come back when in Jogja.
"The hotel is not so far from airport and really easy to get it. Looking so calm and quite place. The lobby is really nice. Staff will welcome you with flower necklace, fresh flowers with nice scent. Big room and clean, spacious bathtub. Our room have a terrace that connects directly with the golf course with a beautiful flower garden. At night a lot of bats fly out of the trees and I think it&#39;s very natural. A very peaceful place and is perfect for those who need tranquility. A lot of choice of food at breakfast time there is even traditional herbs if you want to try it. We were never out of the hotel just stay there all day enjoying the garden, golf and just ordered room service for lunch and dinner. All the food from their restaurant was so great! Everything here was perfect</span><span>&hellip;"
I stayed in the hotel during weekend and as usual the hotel always impress me with its good delivery of service. Hotel environment was homey and staffs were deliver high standard of service. Will return back to this hotel.
Need more coordination between the reception desk and the person who book the room in order to avoid embarrassing atmosphere especially for the customers. I have explained everything about my problem in the previous page. The problem was when I hve to checked out in a rush.
A lovely hotel in a tranquil setting with good facilities and superb service from all staff. The rooms are very well kept albeit a little unremarkable. The only disappointment is the food. It was pleasant but not memorable. The selection for breakfast whilst ample lacked variety. Four types of melon does not make a fruit selection.  Too bad if you don&#39;t like melon. A place to relax and enjoy but dining in won&#39;t thrill. 
"Stay here with some friends, we have a lot of fun taking pictures in the garden, lobby, swimming pool... You will really enjoy your stay here with all those beautiful landscapes. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Try their free &quot;andong&quot; service to look around hotel and surrounding area"
"Room and service is excelent.. Just need more treatment on swimming pool because near from garden so many leaves falling on pool.. Nice garden.. For food on restaurant no japanesse food,,i like sashimi.. "
"The Hyatt feels like an escape and a peaceful refuge. Great service, comfortable rooms, the club floor rooms are especially great. Our kids could play at the pool and waterslide all day while my wife and I are able to relax and watch them play."
"1. We booked 3 rooms and when we checked in the afternoon we asked for 2 extra beds. The receptionist confirmed that 2 beds were available but eventually only one is delivered to one of our room until midnight. When we complained, the receptionist who was incharge at that time said that there was no more extra bed available and said that the hotel only confirmed for one extra bed. After some view disputes, the hotel finally gave us one extra bed for free and asked for apologize.   2. We used vallet service but it took too long to deliver the car when we asked for it. We finally took a walk to the carpark and found out that 2 other cars actually blocked our car so it couldn&#39;t come out. The parking management was not capable to arrange the parking and finally we waited for almost</span><span>&hellip;"
"If I was writing about the hotel grounds, the setting, the exterior, this is 5 stars.  A lovely place.  The reason it&#39;s a bit less is the limited menu in the restaurant, and the room size.  The prices are very reasonable, the spa is excellent, you will not be disappointed.  "
"Prior to the hotel arrival, I had a rough flight ended in a hard landing due to the weather causing a little jet lag.. really was looking for a nice rest. Booked the airport transfer already and went straight to the hotel.  It took about 30 minutes from the airport. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a nice hotel staff and she gave me the welcome flower necklace which really has a pleasant smell.. I then instantly realized that this isnt a business hotel but resort hotel instead. At the corridor toward the lobby area for checking in, it has a beautiful scenery overlooking a golf course, it&#39;s all green and homey. Lobby is not massive but large enough, checking in was smooth by the attentive receptionist.   The room: not so special but quite big (Deluxe Balcony Room), sort of old.</span><span>&hellip;"
"We usually stay in this hotel when we are in the area on business. the rooms are always very clean, the service is fine and the grounds are lovely. It is a treat to go onto the roof and watch the sunrise. And sunset is always amazing with the mountain at the center of your view. There are some short trails on the property for jogging. Maybe a total of a mile. The pools are lovely, although I never have time in them. It feels like a complete oasis and very secure, set back from the road, traffic, noise and population. There is a nice golf course. The caddies are all women and all wear pink outfits."
Nice and hommy ... the staff were nice and the food were great. I&#39;ll come back and stay here again. Got a Gold passport facilities and great service. I hope I can get more promo. Love the pool where I can play with my kid and had so much fun :)
"Second stay in hyatt yogya, first time was 10 years ago. The hotel was massive with super nice lanscape and garden. Room was of decent size with good design and layouts. The hotel also allowed us for early check in which was nice after flying early in the morning. So overall good stay. We however feel that the hotel needed some upgrades, given its age, despite overall good maintenance. Bathroom especially, as bathtub looked old with curtain to take a shower while there was also no shower hose."
"This is the best resort hotel in the middle of city, strongly recommend for business and leisure, and best for family stay too. Specially for golfers, close to Merapi Golf and halfway travelling to Magelang, 9 holes golf course at this hotel is also amazing experience....."
This hotel should be considered as benchmark to many other hotels in Indonesia when it comes to service and understanding customers needs. Going there for business as well as for leisure can be ideally considered. There is enough space to find privacy. Breakfast is a dream as food is of highest quality. We visit this hotel frequently.
"We stayed a few night at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, and enjoyed very much the property and its service. The property is not the newest, but very well maintained, and the garden &amp; swimming pool area are beautiful and a little paradise in the middle of a very busy and noisy city. Rooms are absolutely nothing special, but still comfortable and welcoming. Great service. Issues with billing that took a lot of time to solve (price on room service menu was different than the room service bill, and it took over 90 minutes to solve - a lot when in vacation). We had hired a driver to take us around the city, and getting back to the quiet and nice hotel was really a treat."
"This Hotel has a great Atmosphere from the minute you check in , all the staff from the front desk to our waiter at breakfast  were lovley and helpfull and really made our stay , the hotel is located out if the city in very pretty surroundings the swimming pool and Booggys Terrace are a must to see . Thank you very much"
"Hyatt is one of the best hotel in Jogja. Because of something, we moved here from previous hotel at 10 pm without any reservation before.  Even the hotel ocupancy is high (almost full), their duty manager (mr yanuar) still give his best effort to serve us, give us any available room.   At the second day, something happend in hyatt, and we have to move again to other hotel. And again mr yanuar give his effort to for our moved and he coordinated with other hotel so we can to moved easily.  I think this hotel have a great level of services, and if you want to get holiday, business and meeting at Jogja, you can feel the warmth of service from Jogja Culture at Hyatt. Their service is great.  "
"Hyatt Regency Yogya has a fantastic location in the centre of the city, making it easy for our driver to get us everywhere. Service was great, and the pool even has a slide! Service staff were very attentive and friendly. One gripe though, is that the deluxe room was supposed to have an additional living space, but it was outside of the room (it was a balcony, but there was absolutely no deck chairs or anything whatsoever so it was useless space to us). Otherwise, would highly recommend."
"You have to enjoy the pool they have here. It was huge with various sections, so you&#39;ll find a spot for you and your family. They also have a couple of slides with one that is quite huge. Not many people so you don&#39;t have to queue.  Another plus for this hotel is the wide range of breakfast. From western style to the local food. Plus, they serve local jamu. If you do not dare to eat street food, this is the place to try them all. However, during our visits there i can feel that they were understaff during breakfast session. We have to wait a bit to get our baby chair. Not quite attentive for a 5 stars hotel.  But unfortunately the room was a bit on the down side. They certainly need refurbishment especially for the bathroom. A bit dated. A quickfix probably the tiles or perhaps</span><span>&hellip;"
"Best hotel l have ever been! Amazing garden, nice staff and service, nice rooms, good room service, excellent breakfast! Clean and beautiful hotel! Definately go there for a holiday!! Garden and swimming pools are perfect!! never seen anything so nice before in the hotel! Definately 5 star worth!!!"
"The hotel is nicely and uniquely designed to the famous Borobudur temple. Room is spacious enough and deluxe room has balcony with canopy to relax in the morning or late afternoon.  I particularly love the garden and swimming pool, and of course the friendliness of the staffs. The garden which is adjacent to the golf course, home to many different plants, including coconut and durian!.  Garden would look romantic around sunset and blue hour time. Nice for romantic dinner too. Food was also sumptous for both breakfast and dinner."
"Been to this hotel with my family n so impressed with the welcome greeting n also the welcome drink. The check in process didnt take so much time..The bfast also very great..The kids also had great times there.This hotel offer lots of activities n free of charge for the inhouse guest. We can do fishing, free andong ride, pingpong etc. I recommend this hotel for family who wanted to have &#39;all in&#39; family recreation"
"This hotel has modern building and wonderful garden. It is a resort hotel and location is not in the city center. The room is spacious and the amenities were of high quality. Its breakfast was also very good, and the staff were helpful and friendly. Very good hotel but there is nothing to see around it."
"Simply one of the best hotel in Jogja if you are looking to stay and enjoy hotel facilities and relaxing the whole day. The hotel was clean, comfort, design was great, facilities is more than you expected, golf course, jogging track, pool, bird&#39;s cage, tennis court, even they have Andong for kids experience. I would book this hotel for next trip to Jogja."
"Very recommended place to stay. quite, clean, helpful and lovely staff, near to the city but no noisy. they have a  beautiful kemangi restaurant with a beautiful view, the swimming pool and golf couse. I love the taste of your lava egg by the way. Thanks Hyatt Jogja."
"An excellent hotel with great staff, amenities and food. It&#39;s a pleasure to stay at the Hyatt Yogyakarta.  It&#39;s more of a resort experience than a normal hotel stay.  The pool and spa are excellent and the shuttle service to and from Malioboro is very convenient."
"The hotel far enough from the center of Yogyakarta (with which it is connected by free shuttle at fixed times), has few attractions and restaurants within walking distance. We got upgraded to a large and luxurious suite, with a large terrace, which has made our stay very pleasant. Large gardens (with decorations and shrines of style reminiscent of Bali) and a long pool (with water-slides and wide spaces reserved for children) make your stay particularly suitable for families. Regency Club with a decent selection of food for the cocktail time."
"The hotel has an amazing garden, it has a very nice look, the pools are nice, you can see the golf course. The rooms might be a bit old but are from a high quality, the staff is very friendly and deliver a great service. The breakfast is sublime. A great stay!"
"The Hyatt Yogyakarta looked like a Balinese resort, with its palm trees and bougainvillea, expansive grounds, and open areas. We had access to the concierge lounge, where everything was first class -- from the warm staff to the food and ample seating. We had an early flight out and had to leave for the airport at 5:45am. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that (complimentary for us due to club lounge) breakfast began at 5am. The only negative is that there&#39;s nothing of any use around -- but the hotel has a complimentary shuttle to nearby areas (which we didn&#39;t use)."
"Stayed or four nights at the end of October 2015.  This really is a very nice place to spend some time. Most importantly it is very clean and the staff are amongst the most pleasant, charming and helpful I have come across anywhere. Most staff speak really good english too.  The gardens are beautiful and the pool is large and really well landscaped. It is a great way to start the day having breakfast at a table overlooking the waterfalls and statues. The breakfast selection is pretty extensive catering for most tastes from European all the way through to Asian.  What lets this hotel down very slightly (and the reason it doesn&#39;t get 5 stars ) is that the rooms, especially the bathrooms are a bit dated and tired looking even a little shabby. Everything works perfectly well and the</span><span>&hellip;"
"Our group of five arrived and were checked in by friendly and efficient staff. We enjoyed delicious snacks and cocktails while our luggage was taken to our rooms on the fourth floor. The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious. The bathrooms were large with separate shower and bath. The view was magnificent overlooking the pool and well maintained gardens. The buffet breakfast is extensive with both local and international cuisine available and seating either inside or outside. On walking through the gardens, we felt like we were walking through paradise. We enjoyed two nights here and highly recommend this hotel. We would definitely stay here again."
"I have been visited The Hyatt Regency since the opening in 1998 and I was never disappointed, from the check in, during the stay and till leaving the staff is always very helpful and friendly! The food, especially the breakfast is superb and so are the drinks served at Bogeys Golf club. My friends were satisfied as well and we really got top service for top price.....we used the Regency club where you also get your privacy, will be back soon for sure"
"room was very noisy, can feel like earthquake if there is some movement from next door or on top  upgrade to regency club, but NO cold water at sink  maintenance come but can not fix in short time Already 11 pm so forget it, need to sleep"
This is a fantastic hotel for people who just want to relax. The beauty about the hotel is that it&#39;s not too big but very comfortable. Yogya is ok-ish but the hotel is very well maintained and well run without having the feel of a conference hotel. Wouldn&#39;t spend more than a couple of days there but it is the place to unwind. Food is ok and the service and staff are very nice but not very pro-active. Would come back again and will definitely take the kids because the pool is just great.
"Stayed there for 3 nights with our 5 year old. The property is huge with lovely greens and the most awesome pool if you are with children. The slide is a big winner - kids and grown up alike. While the external facilities and area was excellent, I found the room old and tired. We were on the same floor as the lobby but I think there are other rooms that are better. First for the property and location, the room is small and fairly basic and bathrooms are functionally ok but very very ordinary.  The breakfast is a very good spread with a fair mix of local and international fare and adequate offerings for vegetarians. Infact the Al a carte menu too offers good vegetarian choices. The service at the restaurant is excellent however it is a bit sketchy at the front-office. Nobody</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed for 4 night with my wife on a recent trip to visits the temples and surrounding region.  The hotel is one of my all time favourites when it comes to landscaping and design of the hotel grounds. Absolutely gorgeous. The attention to detail with the temple style replicas in real volcanic rock, and the the pool landscape are amazing.  Very relaxing when you want to take some time off after a hard day of sightseeing.  The breakfast is great. Huge variety.  Best part. The rates are so cheap. We payed about 80 USD/night for two with breakfast. A steal. The room. Perfectly fine size. Good beds. Nice TV with lots of channels.  It is a bit dated though what design is concerned. A lot of reviews mention this.  Therefore my mark down of 1 notch overall. Don&#39;t get me wrong. It is</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stay at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for one night with my partner, we stay at deluxe room at 4th floor facing the garden.  The hotel it self has been old.  My first visit was around 10 years ago, bu tI still keep my memory well about this hotel .  You can not escape some tired signs a bit here and there, but in general I am glad they still maintain the hotel very well .  We came in October, which is coincidenly in th emiddle of dry season in Java.  They indeed maintain the garden, but in some area, you cant defeat the nature.  They have a great pool with very suitable not only for those come with family and children, but also for couple looking for romantic scene.  My partner and me enjoy very much walking areound the garden, swimming at the pool, and just lay down enjoy our times.</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed for 5 days in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, and what can i say? I never want to leave it!  (+) When we entered the hotel, we were welcomed by a string of jasmine flowers in our neck, and then we entered their outdoor lobby. The outdoor lobby have a fish pond, my son loves it. And the ambiance took us to the relax state.   I stayed in deluxe room on 4th floor. The room is basically basic, but clean, and have complete amenities + daily fresh fruits.  The breakfast is superb. They have continental, asian and even local cuisine. The restaurant is facing the swimming pool so we have a nice view over there. We also have lunch there, the Roti Prata is so delicious, the Spinach Cannelloni tasteful. Even my son&#39;s kids pizza taste very nice. We also ordered mushroom soup, so yummy</span><span>&hellip;"
"I spent 2 nights in this hotel with a girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. I informed the staff in advance that is was her birthday and she was surprised to find a birthday cake in our room on arrival. What a personal touch! We loved this hotel from the moment we stepped out of our taxi on arrival and were presented with a fragrant jasmine necklace and a cool drink. The rooms were great but more than that the traditional Indonesian architecture is stunning and the grounds are lush and tropical. We made good use of the facilities enjoying the delicious buffet breakfasts and dinners. We also had a massage and &#39;cream bath&#39; (an Indonesian speciality which is a head, neck and shoulder massage that comes as part of a shampoo and blow dry). The staff were outstandingly friendly and</span><span>&hellip;"
"Whilst the hotel facilities were fabulous, the service at the hotel&#39;s restaurant was appalling. The menu was limited, the staff were incompetent, the service was slow, orders were incorrect and/or incomplete. There was only the one dining option so for a family staying at the hotel for a resort holiday the terrible food and service overshadowed our overall experience at the hotel. The hotel is quite a way out of town so it was not practical to go out for lunch and dinner with small children and we had no choice but to rely on the terrible hotel food."
"This hotel was excellent, stayed here for 3 days and enjoyed every moment of it. The staff were excellent throughout the hotel. The rooms were beautiful and ours in particular had a great view. The restaurant was very good and the breakfast had an incredible variety. Would recommend this hotel to everyone."
"It worth for every rupiah i spend on it.  The service is excellent since the first time i step on it until i leave it . The front office is so help full. My room is just perfect in its way.  The hotel decoration and landscape were breathtaking.  I spend 5 hours in the restaurant by the pool, and feel amazing!  Staffs were so kindly and super help full.  They dont mind to do things if you ask. Superb.  Definitely would love to come back.  "
"Stayed 3 nights in September, the hotels about a 30 to 40 min drive away from the airport,towards one end of the city. So if one wants to stay smack bang in the centre of town then this hotels not for you. That said the hotel offers shuttle service through out the day to the city centre and moreover the main tourist sites are reached within an hour or so which would be the same time from the city centre.  The check in was smooth, the staff offered fresh juice and towels upon check in. We had a room on the executive floor, which was fairly spacious, the only thing missing was a balcony to sit on. The hotels built around a golf course and it offers some pleasing views hence it helps to take a room with a view of the grounds. The Hotel has only one restaurant, but that is fairly</span><span>&hellip;"
THIS was really THE hotel of Java so beautifull iTS like √† dream! Great service and nice suroundings. THE pool is very Nice and the rooms are of THE highest standards I would go there again of I would be there
It was simply love at first sight! I super love everything about this hotel and I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to travel Yogyakarta!  I actually advise that you dont have to go out anymore as this place is really breathtaking!
"Very kind hospitality from the staff, huge and lush green garden, nice javannese architecture design specially in the entrance area, good food, green surrounding,  complete facilities including golf course. Love this hotel so much.."
"The hotel has very spacious court. It is nice to have exercise in the morning. The outdoor pool is lovely. The terrace is beautifully designed with fish pond and Javanese architecture, a very nice place to relax. The breakfast is huge and has many varieties. Normally hotels will adapt the taste, but here the Indonesian food tastes as it does. Although the room is a bit old, but the atmosphere, ambience and service are excellent!"
"Very peaceful yet enough to entertain the kids. Shame the online booking system is so poor, making it difficult to book the deals advertised. Other than the teething booking issues, service was good, staff friendly and breakfast and pool divine."
Hyatt Regency is an oasis of calm and tranquility amidst beautiful palm tree setting and a wonderful golf course. You are welcomed with Jasmine flower garlands and a refreshing drink. Rooms are spacious and staff are exceptional :) Great Breakfast spread too! Hyatt Regency arranged for a trip to the beautiful 10th century Prambanan Temples (40 mins drive) - best to go early morning before the crowds of visitors flood the area.  Thank You Hyatt Regency and to Ms Fitri for the great service!
"Cool place to unwind and away for a break! Plentiful of place for a walk, swim or jog. The breakfast is full of varieties next to the swimming pool which is awesome. The fitness club has a jacuzzi which is available to the hotel guests. There are also great eateries within walking distance!"
"The hotel is great and has a lot to offer. Breakfast is very good, the pool and surrounding gardens are beautiful, and I loved the service. However the bedrooms could be bigger. I was and always am very happy with the Hyatt."
"Best place, complete facilities, cozy, all you need are here......you feel like in a heaven, this place is suit for honeymooner, business trip and other traveler. The only lack thing is quite far from the centre of town (Yogyakarta) and airport but overal it&#39;s very recomended hotel if you go to Yogyakarta"
Landscaping is grate and directional maps are quite clear to be able to enjoy easy walk around the coumpond. Swimming pool is romatic and spiral water slope for children is fantastic. Breakfast gave a variety of choice from europian to local foods and soups. Wifi is really working and fast.
"I stayed in this hotel for a week, during a visit to Yogyakarta. The staff, were exceptional always eager to assist and sparing no effort to ensure a great experience. On Monday morning the management was in the dining room (a beautiful space). Interacting with guests, enquiring about their stay their plans and even providing useful information about sights and activities. The main restuarant is open from 6:30 am to 11:00 pm; the breakfast buffet is literally huge and so varied that one would be at pains to decide. From Indonesian favourites to vegeterian choices and everything in between. The the pool is expansive and literally set in a tropical garden, along with a 2km jogging track and the 9 hole golf course this is truly a gem. One thing; if booking do it via the Hyatt</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel is great for families . The room and bathroom are a bit outdated . But the surroundings starting from the pool, garden, restaurants are excellent. The location of the hotel are good. Not so far from the city and nearby there are good coffee shop. The price are also quite affordable for a 5 star hotel.  This hotel are more suited for those who wants to relax"
"Great place to kick back and relax although there are hotels with better rooms in town for the same price point. The advantage here is the golf course, gardens and excellent spa. The rooms are not as modern as some other hotels but nonetheless have decent facilities. Overall we had a pretty good stay. The swimming pool and gardens are fantastic although one moron was flying a drone helicopter with a camera above the swimming pool area one day which got old pretty quickly."
This was my third stay in this property.  Nice room! Beautiful pool and gardens.  Breakfast spread was just awesome. Location is great too. Close proximity to the highlights of Yogya. Highly recommended. 
"The property in itself is very big &amp; nice. Its approximately 30-45mins from the Airport.  The staff is very friendly &amp; helpful but I think its in general the whole of Yogyakarta that they are not comfortable with English which makes it a bit difficult to communicate. We kind of accepted Hyatt being the big chain to be better with this. The staff of course make a great effort but you have to be very slow &amp; express it better to get it through.  The rooms were decent &amp; so was the food. Mainly its the local food that they serve &amp; a few pizza &amp; pasta dishes but I think its better to stick to the local fare which is good.  The breakfast spread is huge mainly Asian but also with live eggs, waffles &amp; pan cake counters. By the end of our 3 Nights 4 days stay we had almost tried</span><span>&hellip;"
"Great hotel; well maintained, top service level from welcoming and accommodating staff, great facilities and a multitude of complimentary activities for families: Swimming pool w great slides, fishing pond, horse carriage, free shuttle to centre.   Has as well nice Saturday night Ramayana show and inhouse travel agency to arrange tours.   We had a great time with our 8 year old son.   Only negative is the state and condition of the changing rooms and toilets by the pool - which is worn down, smelly and dirty. Quite surprised with that - but trust Hyatt to fix and keep the high standard on here as well.   Thanks for a great holiday.   "
"I enjoyed the big open space of this hotel. This is surely a good place for families with kids as there are a plenty of activities they can enjoy. I and my husband also enjoyed the pool, walking along the path, playing tennis, etc.   The room is a very standard room and the hotel should really replace the very tired sofa with a new one and regularly check and maintain everything in the room (e.g. water was leaking around the sink, etc), but the stay was generally fine.   The service was in general slow (e.g. checking-in), and this was quite irritating at the restaurant (I had to check about drinks we ordered after not receiving for more than 20 mnts). The food option and quality is not great but acceptable. There were a lots of rooms for improvements for service and the menu."
"A marvelous hotel in an amazing location a real paradise!!! Much better than I was expected it was a nice surprise to discover. You have nothing to worry the service is excellent, everything you need you have it.  "
We are pleased with our recent stay at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. Reception at RC was done without any hassle. One negative remark about face towel placed on the floor but not replaced. Delivery of paper (KR) to the room and supply of other paper at Kemangi Lounge is good
Stayed here for 3 days. Rooms are overlooking the golf course on the high floors. Amenities &amp; decor need a little bit of updating. Overall experience is great including breakfast meals. Had a very warm welcome by the front desk when we arrived. Great massage after a game of 9 hole at the course next to the hotel. We had a Javanese cultural show on a Saturday night together with our Buffett dinner. Great experience. Complimentary rides to the city centre ie. malioboro street.mWill definitely stay there again.
"Synopsis: Beautiful grounds, good service (it is Indonesia after all) but rooms and common areas are aging. If the price is right, I would go again but otherwise look elsewhere.  The service manager did what was possible given the constraints of aging, outdated hotel rooms.   First impressions: Beautiful and expansive landscaped grounds. The walk to the lobby is through calming (small) water bodies on either side of the walkway. The lobby appears to be full of light and  spacious, reminding one of a hotel set in colonial times.   Negatives: It took almost an hour to check us in to the hotel. This pretty much started a bad chain of events. The room that we were checked into had hair in the bathtub, ‚Äúfloaters‚Äù in the toilet, the welcome fruit had been sitting for a while leaving</span><span>&hellip;"
With Kids this is a great place to get away.  With the pools and slides right there we can relax and let the children play in the pool and on the water slides.  Kids can also go fishing and they had a blast.  Staff is very responsive to requests and needs and even remember you on returning trips (like this one).
"We stayed in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for 7nights. Excellent resort in the outskirts of the city. Everyone from the hotel front desk to the restaurant smiled and greeted all the way.  Airport Transfer was provided by Hotel &amp; is very convenient. Andong Ride (Horse cart) was good and my kid enjoyed.  This hotel is kids friendly. My son (aged 5 years) thoroughly enjoyed every part of the stay, from multi level swimming pool, slide in the pool, fishing pond etc. There is a health club available offering Jacuzzi and Sauna.  Restaurant: Breakfast is excellent with variety of spread from Asian, Local Indonesian and Western spread. They had several stations for fried egg, local food, pizza, bakery etc. We had lunch in Kemangi Bristro on several days. Food is excellent &amp; service is too</span><span>&hellip;"
"We all had a pleasant stay. Cozy bed, wonderful pool-side breakfast under green canopy, and relaxing ambience. We had a nice spa therapy and bike tour as well! But most important is the room-rate we had was a killer-deal!"
"I stay for one night at this hotel for the first time, and i am very love this hotel, the staff very friendly, thank to chaterine and ratna(if i am not forget the staff name), they are very friendly and do my check in prosses with proffetional and fast , i am very impressive when they are allow me to early check in, the hotel its self very green, stunning garden and golf view, i recommended this hotel and i will back at my next visit for sure "
"Nice view.  The garden, golf view , pool make our mind really relax. Enjoy the breakfast with complete menu. There&#39;s so many option for you to start the day with.  You get what you paid for. hahahha. Get privacy as you want. And thank&#39;s for welcome flower and the &quot;pia&quot; . Get honeymoon moment at here perfectly. "
"the lobby of the hotel is very nice, with water landscape and nice view, but the room was horrible, very old, dirty and dark, feels like a hostel.  the breakfast was average, nothing special. but the garden and the view outside is beautiful."
"Stayed here from Aug. 27-29, 2015 with my friends. One of the most photogenic hotels I&#39;ve been to. Everything was so beautiful - the gardens, golf area, pool, rooms, etc. The staff were very accommodating. The amenities and services were really world class. The rooms were huge. They clean your room twice a day, plus replenish your water and fruits often. The pool area was so huge. There are plenty of things to do here that you might not even want to leave the hotel. :p You get free use of the jacuzzi and sauna, plus a lot more. The breakfast selection was so huge. Too bad I can&#39;t try everything. ;p Tried waiting at the rooftop to see the mountains but it was foggy at that time. I loved the location. It wasn&#39;t too far from the main landmarks and it was not too noisy. Would stay</span><span>&hellip;"
"This is like a must-stay Hotel whenever you in Yogya:) We&#39;ve been staying here every year constantly for our Holiday in Indonesia. We feel like home here thats why we always coming back:). They have beautiful lush big garden with beautiful big swimmingpool, having such a big golf field, having traditional Dance every weekend, having great foods, very helpful staffs &amp; if you get bored you can learn how to cook indonesian food which will be held on the open air on the golf field, they providing shuttle bus to go to the city for free, but try to avoid to stay during Indonesian Holidays if you prefer quiet stay. The GM Mr Nur is really a down-to-earth person, very friendly &amp; attentive, he&#39;s always greet us every morning when we having bfast at the Regency club, he&#39;s even invited us</span><span>&hellip;"
"It&#39;s like staying in a palace! The hotel is massive, plenty of things to do in the hotel if you don&#39;t feel like going out; 5 swimming pools, big park, outdoor sport activities, spa, massage pretty much anything u want!  The staff is very very friendly and the service was excellent.  PS: .. do not miss out on the breakfast!!!! It was delicious with plenty of choices to choose from.  I will definitely be back to this hotel!!  Well done Hyatt Regency!"
The hotel is clean with welcoming atmosphere.  Located within one hour of any attractions.  Good and caring staff.  Plenty of tour package options.  Nice golf course and pool facilities.  Ideal for family stays.  very good Breakfast Buffet
"We stayed in the hotel for three nights. It is a nice hotel with kind and helpful personnel. The facilities are in good conditions (rooms, swimming pool, sport facilities, golf course). Strongly recommended as a place to recover after or before backpacking :) "
"We stayed 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Extremely friendly staff , lot more than I expected being my first visit to Indonesia. Resort style children friendly facility well away from noise pollution. My advice is to use hotel transport to and from the airport."
"A little north of town, the Hyatt is convenient for the airport and Borobodur,  Less so for Malioboro and the Center which are about 20-30 minutes away under normal conditions.  The grounds are well laid out and offer a welcome break at the end of the day.  Restaurant on premises was fine, but as is often the case, emphasized the buffet.  Service was very good"
"You never want to leave this hotel upon having checked in. The swimming pool is big and clean. The staff are friendly and well mannered, and make you feel welcome and comfortable. The health club have sauna and jazzuji, with male and female section. The restuarant serves a varieties of lndonesian and Western cuisines, and the price is reasonably cheap. The surrounding environment is fantastic, lots of trees, and a golf course just by the side. It is a good place to relax as the hotel is located in a very quiet place."
"This hotel is very huge with its garden. Nice garden view and fresh air at morning. You can walk around the garden to feel the fresh air and tall tree.   Free wifi in the room which i used now to write review, suitable for your business trip  Worth it price, compare with other 5stars hotel  But, breakfast menu is not vary, and some of food are no taste.  Overall good hotel for business and family"
"I&#39;d fully recommend this hotel to any travellers looking for a quiet escape. Our room was spacious, well equipped and clean with a comfortable bed. The grounds are stunning, as is the large swimming pool. All food we had here was also excellent!"
"We just came back home from our trip to Yogyakarta today.  Spent 3 nights at the King club room.  The Hotel: The hotel has beautiful grounds and nice swimming pools.  It immediately gave a relaxing tropical resort feel when we arrived.  The Room: Check in at the Regency club lounge was efficient.  We arrived early at the hotel before 11am and our room was already ready.  The room itself was simple and nothing to shout about.  I like the tiled flooring of the room.  Feels so much cleaner than carpets.  The room deco is pretty old, but nonetheless the room was clean and well maintained.  I have no complain.  We asked for late checkout at 2pm and they acceded to our request without a second thought.  Not sure if it is because I am a Hyatt Platinum member, but nonetheless, the early</span><span>&hellip;"
"This 5 star hotel a bit outside Jogja was a real treat. You can stroll in their refreshing park and bathe in their beautiful swimming pool to catch your breath after running in and around the city the whole day. The staff is nice and available, the only minor detail is that the hotel is a bit far from the centre (25-30 min, depending on the traffic jams which can be frequent. They offer a free shuttle during the day to go back and forth from the city centre but the schedule is fix and you need to book it in advance.  Breakfast was amazing, so much choice and so elegantly presented. Omelettes, fried eggs, pancakes prepared at the moment."
"I stayed in the hotel for business trip. The hotel gave me homey feeling. Staffs service was excellent and good quality of food. Hotel location is a bit north of central Yogyakarta, which is away from hectic Yogyakarta traffic. I love jogging track around the hotel and the view overlooking golf course and the mountain. Will come again to this hotel, for sure."
"New experience to stay in Jogja, the room was very clean, all the staff so polite, breakfast is very delicious, the poll just sooo nice  Highly recommend hotel to stay in Jogja, I will surely come back to this hotel when visit Jogja again"
"The hotel will give u Javanese atmosphere with a large tropical garden, amazing pool, and very helpfull staff. Good breakfast from ava ( jajanan pasar ) till american foods completely.  It&#39;s really an exotic place to relax. We are really enjoyed that time. We recommend to stay here."
"I would definitely recommend this hotel. From the entrance with a great view on the golf camp, to the swimming pool and the marvellous hall and interiors, I loved everything about this hotel. Nice rooms, great breakfast and perfect location, isolated from the chaos of the city but close enough to reach the center within 10 minutes by car, if I ever come back to Yogyakarta, I would for sure stay at Hyatt"
"Decent rooms, friendly and courteous staff, beautiful hotel grounds with mature trees and water features. We spent most of our time at the hotel - just lazing by their awesome pools, played ping pong, swam, rinse and repeat.   Local food at the hotel was great, we ordered nasi goreng kampung 3 times! I&#39;d recommend the Ramayana Saturday Night Market for a cultural experience - good hawker style food while watching the Ramayana dance.  It was easy to organise airport transfer, reserve seats for the shuttle to Malioboro Road. Overall, a good experience with logistics of the stay.  WiFi is available throughout the hotel.  If you&#39;re looking for a holiday where you&#39;d mostly stay at the hotel, this is it. Ample things to entertain you, good service, beautiful surroundings - probably</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed here  with my friends and family on August 7 until 8. We booked 3 suites and 5 standart rooms. Overall we loved our stay so much. The view and the garden was so beautiful. The pools were huge and clean. There were massive selection for breakfast at the coffe shop, we should walk slowly from corner to corner to taste all the foods.  The hotel decor was quite classic, with some defacts in the rooms, that need to be fixed. Maybe this is the time for Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta to do refurbishment.  One thing I regret on Hyatt, is the front desk staff. Upon check in, no one from front desk staff explain to us about our suites benefit and wi fi password. We were there for an event, and no one notice about our suite benefit, until we check out. We never knew that we had</span><span>&hellip;"
"Having its own golf course is a plus point for this hotel, especially for golfers. For non-golfers they get to enjoy the nice greenness view, along with nice gardens. The service was great, we were greeted by Javanese hospitality. The foods were nice but a bit expensive. The room was average."
"We stayed at this hotel for four nights. Literally everything was perfectly arranged. The staff of the hotel make you feel at home immediately. They are very helpful and nice. This is a five star hotel but is not as stiff as your normal five star hotel. All kinds of people visit this hotel. People with children, young couples, older couples. The rooms were very clean. Service excellent. It&#39;s actually so good that any review doesn&#39;t do it just. You must experience it."
"This hotel is just the perfect anti dote for Jogja. After a busy day (city, tempels, etc) its so great to come here where its a heaven. The pools, the gardens, the service and every morning the breakfast."
This has to be one of our peak national and international hotel stays. Customer service is delivered with great dedication and a genuine heart of wanting to serve. It was excellent that the room WIFI was free AND that engineering helped fix our problem with 3 point power cords and rigged us an adapter.
"We had a great time chillax in the hotel last week. I&#39;m four-month pregnant and basically this trip meant for us to relax under a safe and serene environment. Hyatt obviously was a good choice where my husband and I enjoyed our stay there very much. The food served was good, with a lot of variety and high quality. My husband loved the Kampung Fried Rice most. Highly recommended for long stay."
Excellent relaxing family hotel in a great location far enough to be away from the hustle of the city but still in easy reach of everything. Hotel transport from airport very professional and reasonably priced as were the hotel arranged tours. Would have preferred to have the option of a family room instead of two rooms but we did not appear to have this option when booking online. We would definitely come back...
"Very good experience with this hotel: friendly, helpful staff, beautiful grounds and pool, ability to easily organise sight-seeing and transport, quality restaurant.  The only sore point was the spa that was functional but not up to the standards of such a great hotel."
"I had booked this Hotel over the Internet 4 weeks prior our arrival and it was a very good value for money deal with around 70$. U.S.The breakfast buffet is very large and great local as well international selection. the pool area is also very nice considering the Hotel is around 30 plus years old.the Club lounge was also of good quality Would I go back, yes anytime. "
"This resort is like a tropical oasis. The moment you enter the gates, you drive up a lush and mature landscaped driveway to the drop off area. The decor is infused with classical javanese architecture, with nice touches of volcanic rock sculptures/chedi to remind one of Borubudur. We were at the Club Wing. The Club lounge serves continental breakfast and also cocktails in the evening. As a Club guest, you can opt to have your breakfast at the main coffee house instead at no charge. I found that the breakfast at the coffee house was much better as it had a very good selection, in addition to being much more spacious. Breakfast on the terrace next to the pool was just so relaxing. Interesting to note too that pork is not served here. The pool area is very well scaped. There are</span><span>&hellip;"
"my room was nice, friendly staff, lots of things can be done here, great for family. but it&#39;s also good for couple, too bad for me and my girlfriend that we had to checked out early in the morning. nice hotel though"
"The Good: The property is huge, with lots of activities for families. My little boy loved fishing, and that giant slide in the pool. Breakfast was good, lots of options.  The Bad: Jogja is a place where you come, not for a relaxing weekend, but a hectic sightseeing-filled couple of days. So you really need to just crash in your room..... And that&#39;s where the hotel disappoints.. Our room was tiiiiny, the furniture and decor dated and drab, and we got bored of the limited food options at the hotel fairly quickly.   The Ugly:  The room. We always stay at the Hyatt in Bandung, and the rooms there are so nice. The floor of the room had stains, like a carpet had been ripped out, so it always looked dirty :("
"I spent a comfortable another comfortable night at the Hyatt. The rooms are starting to be in need of renovation and the prawns in my Tom Yum soup were rubbery, but overall a good hotel and I will be back. The gardens and pool are very tranquil"
"nice hotel in Yogyakarta, very relax, big garden and swimming pool internet works fine however they only give 4 device per room, annoying for people travelling with laptop, mobile and tablet. friendly stuff"
"Hyatt is well-known hotel in the world and we have very good experience during our 3 nights stayed in hyatt yogyakarta. Good staff,good service,tidy and clean room and the best thing is the swimming pool. My kids were happy to explore the pool."
"After more then 10 years not staying at Hyatt Regency, finally we came back for short 3 days stay. We got reasonable rate from Agoda inclusive BF. You cannot get more with the rate paid. The room was still well maintain, clean even towel looked over used but smell clean and dried. No complaint about the room. We were so happy to have room no 457 with big balcony in the side of the room and big glass window looking the big garden full of big trees. Everything was perfect as well as lagoon pool. Quality of BF was the same with variety of the foods prepared but I found less import products like yogurt and jams. But it was not bothering us and not missing it.  I absolutely will come back"
"There is no rat race in Jogja and it is evident in the genuine heart-felt service we received from the well trained polite staff who speaks English perfectly.   Everyone from the check in counter and the concierge provided us with good tips and advice on plans for our itinerary.  We stayed 4 nights here and and felt that we were well taken care of. What we enjoyed during our stay : 1) Awesome service staff, ramadan did not put a dent in the clockworks. 2) Breakfast under the canopy of trees; it was a wide spread hyatt style and quality was 5-star. 3) Adjoining golf course 4) Knowledgeable and dedicated masseurs at the spa 5) Lush green grounds with matured trees, only possible in decades old hotels  Only bummer :  the place is in need of a thorough renovation and new fittings."
"The staff inside is professional. The hotel is very clean. The interior is very luxurious. The breakfast is good. Chicken porridge is the best. Unfortunately, i didnt get any flower necklace when i checked in from the staff outside. It was dissapointing."
"I was staying in this hotel few years ago, this time I choose this hotel again because I know before it&#39;s nice hotel, it&#39;s still the nice and clean, the swimming pool is fun &amp;still many activities that you can do in the hotel! the breakfast is marvellous!"
"We decided to stay here as it was a little out of the centre of town (according to their website 10 mins by car, we never did it in under 20, normally 20 - 30 mins) and the grounds looked lovely.  I&#39;m so glad we stayed here! Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly welcoming staff, and the hotel itself was lovely. We had interconnecting rooms, and they met our needs perfectly.  The hotel is getting a bit old, and the bathrooms are quite dated (I would much rather shower in a shower, rather than in a shower over a bath, but really, first world problem!).  The staff were fantastic, great service and friendly.  The range of pool areas was great, and the 70m water-slide was enjoyed by adults and children alike.  We ate in the hotel several nights, and the food was good. The only</span><span>&hellip;"
"beautiful hotel but we feel somewhat the service is poor, the pool and the garden is awesome, we also like the bycicle facility. please improve the service and hospitality the we&#39;ll consider to be stay at hyatt again our next holiday"
"the staffs are friendly and helpful. The room is clean. The food is nice. But i found the air conditioner on my sister&#39;s room is somewhat not working. Also, i hope they would install a lock on the in-room bathroom. We saw some ghosts around especially near the presidential suite."
Certainly the best hotel in Yogya.From check in to check out . All staf members are doing there uitmost to deliver the best possible service. Beautiful garden and great pool. Please sign in for a Hyatt member for the best possible deal. Thanks again !
"We stayed at the Hyatt 12 years ago and it was a very memorable and nice place to stay back then.  However, we just stayed for another two nights recently and we weren&#39;t impressed.  Firstly, we were not given welcome drinks.  We had seen some other guests enjoying their welcome drinks and that&#39;s how we found out that we should have received drinks when we checked in. But we didn&#39;t.  They took my wife&#39;s passport to enter the details and they put her first name as her surname. And they even spelt it wrong! So the staff were calling us Mr and Mrs (Gwenneth) when her surname is Tan.  They had her passport, why can&#39;t they copy that?! There were no flowers in the room for our two night stay. A previous guest had received daily on their stay.  The room actually smelt like moth balls</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed here three nights. Loved every minute. Had a room with a view of Mount Merapi with a private terrace. Loved the little details such as the tuber roses in the room and fresh fruit. Amazing pool and gardens. The breakfast buffet was amazing and covered both western and indonesian tastes. When you hire bikes, you get your own guide which was fabulous as he took me for a two hour ride along quiet country lanes through ride fields. There is also a free shuttle into Jalan Malioboro. Highly recommend this hotel for some quiet and luxury after serious sightseeing."
"In every Idul Fitri (Eid Mubarak) we always booking this hotel. Great atmosphere for kids, parents and couple. Warmly greeting in main entrance and big smile for us, but this year there&#39;s no &#39;roncean melati&#39; :) My favorite spot is in garden view or balcony one. I hope next year we can be here again and get another great experiences."
"This hotel is a wonderful retreat from the business of the town.  It is lush and peaceful and well laid out.  We had upgraded to a suite and had 2 separate balconies with a nice living room.  Everything worked well.  I appreciated the coffee maker and enjoyed a cup in the morning on the smaller balcony.  The bed was comfortable, and the room had everything you could want.  The pool is huge - actually a pool complex.  Service to bring towels was prompt.  There was a nice slide for the children.  My only criticism, which goes for all Hyatt&#39;s I&#39;ve stayed at, is that they do not have any pool areas that are for adults only. So it is impossible to take a short nap in the afternoon or to enjoy peace and quiet.  Instead there is splashing and running and yelling in all the pools.  We</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed here for 3 nights last week,and this was absolutely a good choice. The beauty of the location,surrounded by  fantastisch .lush tropical vegetation,very friendly service, good food. We had a deluxe balcony room,this was o.k,but not veyry big, spottless clean,but the intiriour is a litllla daten,too much light throughout curtains,balcony not very inviting.soom room have a queen bed,and that is very small,so weghangend into room with kingbed. I saw a clubroom,and i think the moreprice is worth to take these."
"One of the best hotels we ever staid in. Although we have been on many hotels on our trip which were very nice, this one stands out. It is a big hotel, but very nice buildings and decoration. The setting and views are wonderful with much green around. The pool area is also big and wonderfully decorated. Very important since we travel with children. Staff is friendly and service minded. If we should mention a less good point than it would be that the quality of the dishes at dinner was varying. We ordered nasi goreng two times and it did not meet expectations. Other (more international oriented) courses were fine."
"The grounds are large, gorgeous and well maintained. You feel the serenity once you turn off the main road. Multiple pools create pleasant niches to spend an afternoon, swimming or just lazing on the deck chairs. The sea anemone and frangipani plants were trimmed to provide cooling shade around the pool and meal areas. The building facade borrows heavily from Borobudor. Staff generally have very good service orientation.   Housekeeping was generous with bottled water and amenities (including free bottle opener / pen knife). Massage was of a good standard. Room service was prompt -- nasi goreng was good, napoletana pizza excellent. There are many food lima kaki, warung, and restaurants on both sides of the entrance (short walk).   There&#39;s a free shuttle sending to and picking up</span><span>&hellip;"
"This is our 3rd coming to this hotel...the welcoming ceremony is fun,we get flower chains and drinks..the check in is fast and the staffs are helpful and friendly to ask..this is 5 stars hotel but we feel so free being in here..really love the atmosphere and the garden view from our big glass window room..our room is clean and wide enough,viewing to the pool area..the bathroom is cozy but the bathtub is rather small..the wifi connection is not too fast indeed..we love the room service,the foods and beverages are delicious and various enough..our sleep quality is good but maybe we can get more spacious bed later..the breakfast is nice at outdoor area,really relaxing and fresh..the menus are various enough,the staffs are helpful to get our foods and drinks..overall we really love</span><span>&hellip;"
"We had a great 5 day stay here and everything from the breakfast buffet, front desk staff, chefs, servers, recreational facilities including pool, golf course, tennis court, football pitch, were exemplary. Our 9 year old son loved the pool slide. We felt well looked after and have nothing but praise. Thanks to the staff there."
"This hotel has a nice green area including many activities like a pool, golf, tennis, foosball, table tennis, plus plus. Rooms are outdated and would need a refurbishment though. We weren&#39;t so found of the Ramadan dinner buffet on offer, the a la carte menu was nice but limited on offerings. We used the hotel car for our excursion which set back at 90&#39;000 Rupees an hour."
Recently (a week ago) we (wife and self) stayed at this hotel for a week.  Let me begin with the pros; Service &amp; courtesy throughout the stay was exemplary. Hotel gardens and swimming pools are superb Breakfast and meals were satisfactory. Cocktails were good.  Cons: We requested for a packed breakfast to be collected at 3.30am (to visit Borobodur for Sunrise) but it was not given to us. Rooms dated. Bathroom leaking. The hotel has a mini aviary ( birds in a small enclosed area) which is disppointing. But the horrible part of our stay was when we saw traps for trapping birds. In fact we saw a small bird being trapped.  We alerted the management who removed the bird but the trap was still there on the last day of our departure. This is a shame for Hyatt to perpetuate this &quot;</span><span>&hellip;
"I stayed at the Hyatt for 6 days with my family..2 children and a 69 year old grandma. Needless to say there were some requests from us (connecting rooms, a cookie for dessert even if it wasn&#39;t on the dessert menu). All our needs were met and always with a smile! I highly recommend Hyatt!"
"Service is good, better than expected.  Food is excellent  from the menu,room is big, there&#39;s a laundry line in the bathroom, full amenities, request was met..  The bath tub was not comfortable as i has no space to rest my head if i wanted to lay down n not sit upright.  Thou the hotel looks old fashion, it&#39;s homey &amp; comfortable. The ground is big, quiet and full of greenery. No mozzie  Comfy bed and big room. The fruit salak was replenished without saying as i loved it.  Requested the kettle&#39;s hot plate to be cleansed &amp; it came back sparkling clean &amp; spotless.  Ladies at the Hyatt members club are wonderful.. assisted us in many ways.Had free coffee /tea /biscuits and cakes there.  Not sure if the spa is under Hyatt, my hubby &amp; I enjoyed the treatment.Only comment is that the</span><span>&hellip;"
"This is a really nice and tranquil place to stay in Jogjakarta. Great ambiance with many local Javanese charms. The staffs were great and very helpful from front desk/reception, SPA, pool, restaurant, etc. The hotel provides free shuttle service to Marlioboro shopping street. The shuttle runs every two hours and drop off and pick up at the same location on time. We traveled with two children, 11 and 14 years old. They both enjoy the place very much."
I stay in Hyatt Regency Jogja last week. I found the hotel is very peaceful and has a very beautiful scenery. The landscape was designed thoroughly and the maintenance is very good. I must stay this is the best hotel in Jogja if you are looking for a good value at the good quality as well.
"The hotel is located quite close to the airport, about 20 mins drive. It is located away from the city so you can enjoy the quiet countryside but is  conveniently located from the attractions. We rented a car from the hotel and it took about 1.5 hours to reach Borobudur temple and about 45 mins from Prambanan temple. The staff are very friendly and courteous and we were welcomed with Jasmine flower garlands and freshly squeezed fruit drink. The travel desk will organize the visits for you as well as book tickets for the Ramayana ballet at Prambanan. The hotel has luxurious green, sprawling grounds complete with a golf course. The view from the top was beautiful. Volcano Merapi is visible from the suites. It has a beautiful courtyard and the gardens are decorated exquisitely. It</span><span>&hellip;"
"This is the 2nd time I stay in this hotel and I still love it. Good ambience, nice staff and good price. Really reccomend this hotel for family or couples who wants to stay in Yogyakarta. Even though the location not really in centre of the city, but the hotel still haveca great location because it has many options for restaurants nearby. It only took about 15-20 minutes by car to reach into the centre of the city like Malioboro road.  Even though the room is a little bit small and old, but I still love this hotel "
"Looking for that tropical paradise experience with javanese culture? Hyatt is easily one of the best hotel in the city. In recent years, Yogyakarta has massive growth of its hospitality service, almost like every month always a new hotel appears. With its fierce competition, Hyatt, built on 1995, is still the front runner for the top hotel in Yogyakarta. Competing with more modern style, taller but less spacey hotels, it&#39;s the only hotel in the city that will greet you with a large and beautiful tropical garden, a cultural greeting with jasmine flower necklace (jasmine has a very strong influence in javanese culture often used in ceremonial procession) and javanese music. It has a beautiful swimming pool that flow like a river, an outdoor jacuzzi, and also a golf field, it was</span><span>&hellip;"
"Went there on April for a friend&#39;s wedding. The hotel was stand up to its name, although this is an old hotel, but everything is still greatly maintained. My kids loved the swimming pool with all the slide and fun, also the complimentary andhong ride really was fun for them also for me and my wife."
"The hotel is well located and the staff are very friendly. The breakfast was extensive. We had the dinner buffet which again was extensive.  The hotel rooms are dating a bit, especially the bathrooms. The aircon was noisy, and the furniture dated and a bit Shabby. Overall a pleasant stay in a Traditional style hotel, thats quite set it its ways."
"I was there with my family and friends to visit Borobudur and Prambanan temples and was impressed with the large ground that the hotel is sitting on. Away from the hustle and bustle of the traffic, the hotel is a great place to relax and we were happily feasting at the daily snack service from the executive club.  The breakfast serving had plenty of choices and in particular, the delicious lava merapi (fried egg and a signature dish from the hotel) was a daily staple for me. The only down side was that the rooms are rather old and dated, but given the great outdoors we hung out at the general areas more than within the rooms. However, it would really perfect the experience and match up to the Hyatt standards if the rooms get a minor upgrade such as carpets and carpentry. </span><span>&hellip;"
"Hyatt Regency is an old hotel, but there is something special about it. The tranquility and good services reflected the Javanese tradition that was precious especially for a visitor like me. After a very tiring day, here is the place for your to st your mind up and relax."
We are loving Yogyakarta after a week in Bali where the roads and traffic totally put us off returning. This is our 2nd day in Yogyakarta staying at the Hyatt and it&#39;s totally fabulous and great value for money. There are some free things to do at and around the hotel as well as paid things eg we are just about to go on a guided two hour cycle round country paddies and villages for $20AUD. Loving it! 
"We spent 3 day 2 night at deluxe balcony room, the view very beautiful, the facility great they have kids facilities such as kids pool, fishing activity, jogging around the park, &quot;delman&quot; trips around the village..the food also delicious with many local culinary..scenery of merapi mountain..golf range.. Cons: the room furniture a little bit old fashion..should renovate.."
really enjoyed our stay at the resort. I say resort despite the fact its ion the city suburbs. it really is an oasis. you can be in town at the palace in 20 minutes. the shuttle service was great. breakfast had a great variety of western and local dishes to choose from. the pool was huge and even when the hotel was busy there was always a corner of one of the pools to escape to which was quiet. great walking around the edges if the golf course too. staff were very courteous. I would recommend paying a bit extra for a club room as the lounge has a good variety of magazines and books to choose from and what I liked was that television  was on not in there!. good selection of complimentary drinks and canapes in the early evening  .  I would highly reco9mmend this resort in the city.
"From the reviews, i was looking forward to this hotel.  I checked in to a ground floor from with a patio.  From the moment I walked in, there was a smell of mold in the room, however faint.  Faint enough that I didn&#39;t complain.  I arrived late and just wanted to sleep.  The hotel is just gorgeous.  The grounds have everything you need.  Its easy to see why so many tourists flock to this property.  The pool is something to behold. You can swim through grottos and its open 24/7.  Breakfast is also amazing.  There are stations for western and Asian cuisine.  The staff are excellent and are happy to help you with anything.    Its just very humid in Jogja and the ground floor rooms are humid as well. I would still go back with my family, in a heartbeat. My king size bed was very</span><span>&hellip;"
"Great hotel with a picturesque golf course on the grounds. Also has lots of pools, ponds &amp; greenery in the hotel compound.   Had a fabulous time here  - Many complimentary children friendly activities such as a mini soccer area, putting gold, a horse cart ride, billiards, cycling, and even fishing ! - Very friendly and professional staff  - Very reasonable prices on the food/ room service/ transport  - Free shuttle service to Malioboro - Big breakfast buffet spread with lots of choices - Free wi-fi  Rooms are not fantastic but are clean &amp; things were in working order. They are a little dated &amp; I assume they can be noisy as the sound insulation isn&#39;t fantastic.   Overall, a very nice place to stay for a short vacation."
"Very clean and comfort hotel, the staff is also gives very good services. the view in the breakfast next to the pool is great. the bird park is great filled with diffrent kinds of birds. the jogging path gives you a fresh air"
I would like to applaud the hotel for remarkable level of service and hospitality upheld throughout our stay. Right from personalised service at the time of check in to every member of the staff referring to us by name throughout the stay was remarkable. The big and small things that they did to make our wedding anniversary special can not be forgotten. Thanks to everyone at the hotel. The spa and golf facilities were particularly enjoyed but the food menu left us wanting a bit more.   Overall a fabulous and highly recommend experience 
"Nice accommodation, beautiful surroundings and great staff. The pool is excellent. The breakfast has Asian and Continental choices. An airport pickup is also available and a free shuttle to the center. Really recommend it!  It&#39;s a quite oasis in yogyakarta. "
"We stayed two nights at the Hyatt regency. When you get there it&#39;s stunning, and a warm welcome &amp; cold drink greet you. Facilities are excellent, it seems to have everything you&#39;d wish for, beautiful gardens, lounge area and swimming pools especially. Our room was ok, standard larger hotel fare, and they seem to have focussed on ambient lighting rather than task lighting, so the rooms were rather dark in the evenings even with all of the lamps illuminated. No balcony or windows that opened.  The reception team indicated that the hotel was only 40% occupied during the time that we were there, which afterwards made my partner question why we couldn&#39;t have been offered a nicer room/upgrade. Whilst we were staying there as part of a Java tour arranged by a local tour company, they</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed for 4 nights and really have a wonderful time. Was welcome by a jasmine garland and welcome drink upon arrival. When comes the evening,the air is so refreshing cool. Lazing at the open area lounge and overlooking the lush greenery landscape,pool,pond and the golf course is so beautiful. Breakfast is good,they even have the Jamu (traditional herbal drink), the Merapi is yummy too. There is even a (Andung) horse kart ride around the village, only for hotel guest and is free. Even shuttle service to and fro, for Malioboro town. Will return here again."
"Guest rooms &amp; indoor dining area are certainly need to be refurbished. not a downtown hotel. Despite the fact mentioned earlier,  Hyatt Regency Yogya remains the best resort for family esp with young kids as the property has a huge , stunning &amp; picturesque outdoor area. Highly recommended and can&#39;t wait to be back soon."
"i stayed there for 2 nights. the pool was really big, and there was a slide too. the water of the pool was blue and clean. i&#39;m very satisfied because Hyatt has a lot of sport facilities such as tennis court, billiard, fishing, golf, jogging track, and you can go cycling outside of the hotel (it&#39;s open from 8 am to 4 pm) with the friendly guide. i had a lot of fun there, and in the morning the breakfast was quite good, there were a lot of choices from indonesian food until western food."
"I stayed in Room 306 of the Hyatt from June 6-9. It was a business trip.  On arrival, you immediately know that you are being transported to an older, gentler and more tranquil destination. It&#39;s lush and green and tucked away from the sounds of the busy streets of Yogyakarta.  The check-in though did not match the warm welcome of the surroundings. The staff on the phone hardly gave any acknowledgement.   The room has seen better days. The bed felt like it sagged. The curtains were in need of a change. The carpet was clearly worn. Its was old. And it was tired. But somehow, it pulled off it&#39;s age with a forgiving grace.  Reasonable breakfast spread and it offers good outdoor seating by the pool. Service is helpful but slow in delivery.   Big disappointment was the front desk</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed here for three nights. first thing I notice when I arrive is that it&#39;s a luxurious, well crafted landscape hotel the hotel staffs at reception greeted u boyfriend by his name expecting our arrival since morning. They invited us straight to the lounge for registration and offered us a drink of fresh passionfruit juice. We were welcomed warmly by the front desk staff at the lounge and briefed on our room and lounge hours and what the hotels offered. We arrived at 10am and they gave us our room just a bit after 11am and I was pleased because it is early check in. The restaurant on the 1st floor serve buffet breakfast in morning and lunch and dinner. We order their tuna sambam mantis cos it was so good. They used a local black nut sauce which was really difficult to process</span><span>&hellip;"
"Large grounds with medium sized rooms. We stayed in the club rooms. They really aren&#39;t anything special. 36msq. Wardrobe was insufficient. for 2 people as very few shelves. Overall the room needs an update/renovation.  Breakfast was great. Lots of western and local options. Stick to the local options. They are delicious. Also stick to the main breakfast hall as the breakfast in the Regency Club is rather minimalistic (but good). Evening complimentary food in the Regency Club is good and the good branded liquor (JW Red Label, Heineken, etc).Staff in Regency Club was very friendly and helpful. Adinda is very good with making the kids feel welcome.  The restaurant and coffee shop near the lobby is disappointing. We had Pizza which wasnt great (they boast of a wood fired Pizza</span><span>&hellip;"
"If you&#39;ve stayed in any of Indonesia&#39;s bustling cities you know that noise, whether from car horns or minaret mounted loudspeakers reminding the faithful to pray five times a day starting at sunrise, can disrupt your sleep and make reading a book by the poolside an effort which is why this hotel is an oasis. Although it&#39;s only 20 minutes by free hotel shuttle to Jalan  Malioboro the Hyatt Regency&#39;s grounds are so massive that both your sleep and time spent enjoying the hotel&#39;s outdoor facilities are possible in peace. And what beautiful facilities they are, including: 9 hole private golf course; a series of swimming pools and slides called &quot;The Lagoon&quot;; Health Club &amp; Spa, jogging trails, indoor gym, private horse drawn buggy for free country side tours, Bike rentals, indoor and</span><span>&hellip;"
"Great resort with excellent facilities.  Definitely worth the stay with good breakfast too..The resort in in the fringes of yogyakarta with lush greeneries. Will definitely return with family  They had a night performance in the coffee house which was great introduction to the Ramayana story.   Also, spend some time at the swimming pool,  it&#39;s great.   "
"We have a small daughter who loved the fish, turtles, swimming pools and activities on hand. The service personnel bent over backwards to ensure she was well catered for and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.   We felt it would have been good if there was more dining options within the hotel. However, we were able to find great restaurants close by, within walking distance.   "
"Stayed for five days in this hotel.  It was my first time to stay at the Hyatt.  I heard from my friends good things about their Hyatt experiences in the US, so I decided to book and invited two of my close friends.  The place was beautiful and well-maintained.  Staff are generally helpful and attentive.  There were a few issues I raised with them, and to be fair, they tried their best to make our stay more enjoyable.  I was about to forget and just move on with their blunders, but when I was settling my bill, it was two parts, first part was paid upon check in, and we decided to extend two more nights.  When I was settling my extra nights bill, I was charged for five days.  Thinking that I was not double charged, I did not check my bank statement on line.  I only found this out</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed here a few nights to visit the nearby temples. This was one of the biggest hotels we stayed in during our honeymoon but the service and food was excellent. Although the whole hotel could do with an update to the decor the facilities were varied and the Club lounge was a nice quiet place to chill. Many pools to enjoy and slides, fishing pond, golf course, tennis course (if you can stand the heat!). All food options were tasty and catered for all cuisines. We also experienced the Ramayana Ballet which was enthralling and the food delicious and authentic. (Watch out for the Jackfruit curry my Sri Lankan husband even struggled with the chilli in that!) . Overall an excellent stay."
"We stay in this hotel for two nights just to escape from our daily activities. We love almost all side of this hotel Welcome flower when we arrived this hotel is a unique way to welcome guest but front office should be able to make check in procedure faster. We try kemangi restaurant and food is superb and price is reasonable for hyatt. Room is nice in size and amenities but hot water sometimes unstable and room start showing ages. We also enjoy breakfast during our short stay there,especially Indonesian food selection which make this hotel different than ordinary hotel. Anyone who stay here should try Lava Merapi egg its beautiful in shape and taste very good.  One thing we really love is the swimming pool,we absolutely love the water slide its pure fun.  For sure this is one</span><span>&hellip;"
"Upside:  Lovely gardens.  9 hole golf course is fun.  Wonderful pool with waterslide.  Rooms are spacious, food in restaurant is good and well priced.  The Saturday buffet with dance performance was a highlight.  Downside:  The fitness room is very undersized for the size of the hotel, it really should be 4 times as big as it is.  The jacuzzi in the spa was old and didn&#39;t work correctly - never got the jets working."
"We stayed there with our two young daughters (two and four). The hotel is beautiful with a great pool which is divided into several segments that makes it seem like there are several small private pools in that area.  We stayed there two days and visited the temples during the morning and lounged around the hotel during the afternoon/evenings. Unfortunately, on the penultimate day of our holiday, our youngest daughter had a small accident in our room, and the staff was incredibly helpful and supportive in helping us. We truly felt that the staff cared about us and went the extra mile to help us out. We are very grateful for everything they did for us, and we will be coming back as soon as we can to finish our holiday and continue to enjoy the great hospitality of this wonderful</span><span>&hellip;"
"Decided to move out of Manohora in the Borubudor park after two nights and got bored  Impressive landscaped greenery, with 18 hole  golf course on site. Conveys an atmosphere of tranquility.  Welcome was traditional with flower garlands and welcome drink. Cliched, but enjoyable.  Rooms are right sized, but beds sag a bit, indicating refurb well due. Massage in wellness centre was very good.  Food surprisingly and strangely variable. Good in executive lounge, OK in restaurant, but tasteless at breakfast!"
"10 of 10 for this hotel, everything was superb. You will love the pool, the garden, the staff, the service, the room, and Hyatt remember my preferences about baby crib. They also providing pool in the garden for fishing ^^"
"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The guest rooms were well maintained &amp; clean, there are a number of great facilities (pools, water slides, a golf course,etc) the food at the restaurant was good and importantly the staff were very friendly and helpful."
"The comfortable feeling is started as early as we enter the main gate, the lush garden make the typical tropical temperature of Jogja bearable. Soon as we enter the reception area, the premium service begin. We are seated in nice sofa while the staff processing our check in registration. We choose the most modest room, and yet we felt it was a very pleasant premises. The room is efficient with fruits for two, abundant of pillow and room amenities, sizeable TV set, minibar and in room WiFi router. The pool area is the highlight of this hotel especially when you are staying with kids or young hearted people. The water slide is quite long for a hotel and the total area is very generous. We&#39;ve noticed that the hotel have an integrated golf course which can picture the large hotel</span><span>&hellip;"
This is considered the best hotel in Yogyakarta but overall it is less than expected.  On the positive the grounds are very nice and the staff is very friendly but the hotel is dated and the rooms are less than satisfactory. Our room had a broken shower head and even had a musty smell as clearly the rooms need to be updated. It was not a bad stay nor a terrible property but it was overall average.
"Overall our hotel experience was good. The food and the staff in the restaurant were great. The room was okay, but nothing really special. The wifi worked very fast and good. Only the beds were really bad. The hotel grounds are well kept and look beautiful. I would recommend the hotel if you are looking for rest and culture in Yogya."
"Very good breakfast &amp; dinner. Travel agency in hotel if you need one. Friendly staff and good SPA. Beautifull hotel nevertheless bathroom and swimming pool need maintenance. Far from city centre, so taxi or shuttle is needed."
Improve room acoustic system to prevent noise leakage to other guest rooms. Swimming pools should be regularly cleaned from debbries particularly fallen leaves. Ballroom need to be renovated as seems quite old fashioned appearance.
Stayed at this hotel for several times. Since 2005 and always feel at home. Last visit were on 27th may 2015 and still the atmosphere welcoming me warmly. Always impressed with jasmine necklace as welcoming guest...as the smell of jasmine were telling me: welcome home....
"In addition of one of the worst service in the country with inefficient and unfriendly waiters, you&#39;ll enjoy one of the most money-oriented business in Asia ! After paying 20$ for a common brunch, you&#39;ll have to pay 2$ for each glass of water you take. (If the waiter dare sometimes to being it to you after having to ask them 3 or 4 times ...) AVOID THIS PLACE !"
"Currently stay for 3 nights and today is my first and I have just got amazing experience..  It&#39;s a classic hotel with old interior design.. room is very clean with garden view, staffs are excellent, various kind of breakfast, u name it, u got it.. and an amazing pool with jacuzzi! This hotel also have a golf course for those who likes to play..."
"We stayed at the Hyatt for 3 nights, and we were thoroughly impressed by our experience by the time we left. The lush, beautiful landscape was the first thing we saw when checking in, along with a first glimpse of their excellent service - jasmine petal garlands draped over our necks coupled with a refreshing welcome drink at check-in were delightful. Over the next few days we had the most interaction with front desk staff, who were invaluable in giving advice about the places we wanted to visit, and were patient in answering our many queries - they were always friendly and eager to serve! Even hotel staff we passed in the corridors or at the pool were courteous and greeted us with a smile.   We had no issue with the rooms - not exactly the most contemporary but the beds were</span><span>&hellip;"
"If you wanna feel the real ambiance of Yogyakarta, where your soul, body and mind be pleased with its friendly smiley welcome in every corner of the hotel...Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta will fulfill all of your needs. It will be &quot;joss gandos&quot; (literally speaking it will be superb)...Gotta stay there again and again"
My husband &amp; I stayed for 3 nights to celebrate my husband&#39;s 40th birthday. The hotel itself is really nice with a classic interior. The first thing you will see is their lounge area facing the beautiful golf course. The hotel grounds is exceptionally beautiful and well maintained with large outdoor pool. All the staff are very friendly and well versed in English. I will definitely come back again and I highly recommend Hyatt if you&#39;ll be in Yogyakarta.
Had a very relaxing two night stay here. Very green surroundings with a nice walking track around the property. Property sits on a golf course so it adds to the pleasant green surroundings. View from room was wonderful and fresh.  Breakfast buffet was very good. Staff very friendly and helpful.
"Very nice hotel. Friendly and helpful staff giving very good service. Excellent pool and gardens to relax in, well kept golf course. Would recommend the club rooms as you get access to club lounge all day with free tea, Coffey and snacks. Reasonable selection of free drinks and buffet in the evening."
Plus : - beautiful golf landscape  - large outdoor pool and other activities  - well equipped room - long joging (walking) track Minus : - far from city center  - slippery walking track.. Be careful. They should maintain it better 
"The Hyatt Regency is a beautiful and quite spot in busy Yogyakarta. Located a bit out of the city center, you can easily get to downtown by provided shuttle or with a cheap taxi. The stuff is very friendly and welcoming. The building looks like an old temple placed in an elegant garden. Interiors are bright and warm. Our room was clean and spacious, the bed very comfortable. Many different options available for breakfast which was overall ok although the food was often cold. This was the only thing we did not like together with the water in the pool not exactly crystal clear. Overall with we had a pleasant stay at the Hyatt Regency and given the cheap price we would definitely recommend this hotel."
"- Really nice and beautiful hotel grounds, very spacious.  - Swimming pool was great for kids. Comes with slides and rivers. - Breakfast was delicious...many local food to try - Hotel provide quite a few activities to try like andong ride and bicycle tour etc. - Room that we got was deluxe room..was ok..not fantastic. Floor was exceptionally cold in the middle of night. Shower came with bathtub which was a bit troublesome for showering. Would have been good if it was separated. However housekeeping did a pretty decent job. To b honest rooms probably need a major makeover. - TV channels were good with wide selections. - Tried out the spa which was on offer, was ok..but nothing to rave about  Overall the breakfast, pool and beautiful hotel grounds made up for the rooms. But most</span><span>&hellip;"
"I did not stay at this hotel, but I heard from some of people that I knew that they have Sunday brunch.  The food is nice except the sushi, various salad choices and Indonesian traditional food, the brunch opened from 11 till 3 PM and we got to use the pool for free afterwards by showing our brunch bill. The Restaurant is nice but a bit hot , seems AC did not work good, and since we are not staying the hotel, if we need wifi password they gave you password that allowed to use for one hour only...."
"This has that Hyatt feel about it - it shows its age in the type of fixtures and fittings, but the upkeep and maintenance are impeccable. Everything works. Always a good feeling. This particular hotel is a victim of its own success - very, very busy and the kitchen was groaning abut under the strain, especially at dinner."
"Unimpressive hotel with very limited services, no children play area, poor F&amp;B services. However, the good side is they provided excellent concierge, fast check-in and excellent tours. Try booking the sunrise Borobodur trip with Smailing Tour, it was simply amazing."
"The grounds of this hotel are stunning.  Everything else is below par - small, featureless rooms, below average restaurant, average spa (services were fine, but atmosphere was lacking).  For the price, you could probably do much better in Yogyakarta."
"Absolutely beautiful, nice gardens, swimming pool, and golf. Fantastic. Staff very good, hotel kept in good condition. Gardens beautiful. Really hard to fault this hotel. The breakfast had good variety of local dishes."
"Hard to fault this hotel really.  Absolutely beautiful.  Gardens, pool, golf.  Fantastic.  I could only really complain about the breakfast, which has become very localised.  Staff very good, hotel kept in good condition.  Gardens beautiful.  Great Job!"
"The location of this hotel is slightly out of Yogyakarta, but the hospitality of the staff, the lush landscape surrounding around the premises really compensate for it.  I stayed for 5 days for a conference and the first two days already showed the quality of the staff.  From the driver of shuttle service (to Malioboro street for free , namely pak Bondan) who were very informative to the genuinely smiling house keeping staff, and the attentive room service lady who upon noticing that I was ordering food for a kid immediately offer a not spicy option, and especially the staff in camp Hyatt. I had to leave my 5-year old alone and I was frantic. When I called room service, they put my call through a camp Hyatt staff. The next morning, my son spent half day with pak Acong, coloring</span><span>&hellip;"
"it was a wonderful  experiences in a thematic resort hotel, the hotel have many kind of facilities that make your stay more comfort such as the great swimming pool, fishing pond, 9 hole golf field and the hotel theme just like a borobudur temple replica in a lush green athmosphere."
"After a hard days work, it is great to return to a Hotel Lounge, where you are appreciate, Balinese wine flows and great Hors D&#39;Oeuvre are put out every evening by Catur, Agus and their team.  Add to the that friendly service by Fitri, Melryna, Roso and Yulianti (the very attentive Regency Club Staff); and you can have one of the best Decompression after a hard days&#39; work!"
"I was here for a workshop but was greeted with an aromatic gardenia lay and smiles that continued throughout the week that I stayed at the Hyatt. I very much enjoyed the gym and the 2km trail around the premises. They also provided live music on Saturday night and an international night that had a traditional Ramyana ‚Äúballet‚Äù/show, which was amazing.  Food was great and the room was comfortable."
Feel lucky to stay in this hotel with a good price and overall service was satisfied. Food was tasty and it varies from western foods selection to traditional. It also provide a jogging track and an irresistible swimming pool. I promise to my kid to visit this hotel in the future
"My wife and I had an amazing time at the hotel. All the staffs were friendly and helpful. At this location, they did not try to nickel and dime you for everything. The location was great and the free shuttle to Malioboro was a big plus! I will definitely stay at this hotel again. One more thing... They have an awesome water slide/pool."
"I&#39;m just checked out from this hotel for 3 days seminar. The hotel was very good with great view, the only thing is, for 5 stars hotel, the room is too small.  They have the night market every Saturday with the Sendratari Ramayana legend. This is fabulous! And the variety on the night market was also very berry good. "
Stayed there for a night at ground floor which the balcony its connected to the outside. Awesome welcoming services. Very beautiful view and facilities. However the swimming pool its abit dirty and got a few fungus at the bottom. Overall its good. :)
"Check in late at night for 2 nights stay, surprised with welcome flower and welcome drink, lobby nice and cozy. Front desk clerk little trouble to find my reservation, bell boy really helpful showing our room, corridor was nice with fresh flower decoration.  Room temperature quite warm but engineering staff fixed promptly fix the problems, room neat and clean. Breakfast buffet was exceptional with variety of local and international food.  My dinner at Kenangi Bistro was nice and memorable. Just the waiter need little bit training for dinner set up to make it perfect.  Please prepare spare time if you leaving with airplane for traffic jam about additional 45 minutes from regular travel time."
" We arrive with my company group for annual seminar in yogya and The Hyatt Regency is known for excellence good location is no exception. I&#39;ve been in Yogyakarta many times but this was my first stay at Hyatt for my business trip. Won&#39;t be the last. Of course I can relax in amazing the room with volcano and golf view, golf is convenient and so well located in the front so good to extend our stay to play with colleagues. Also amazing breakfasts in the restaurant downstairs included in the rate. But the service was the biggest friendly and organized meeting and convention. The attitude of helpfulness is not canned, it&#39;s warm and sincere. This hotel is not new sometime need some refreshment but I will stay here again!"

"The formidable tandem of Ibu Yulia and Mas Daniel made our stay at the Hyatt Regency seamless with all of my guest from practically all parts of the globe, raving about the warm hospitality, the excellent arangements, the very good food, nice friendly hotel satff, and the special evening events just whipped up for our guest.  All these amid the relaxing atmosphere of the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta! The next time you plan a business meeting, go and find Ibu Yulia and Mas Daniel and look forward to the ideas these tandem could concoct just for you and your team! Well done!"
"Second time there, the hotel keep improving, check in is fast, food is good, green areas are amazing. just perfect for a relax from the city bustle while still being immersed in javanese culture. worth the visit, even for a day."
"i have good experience on business trip,first i&#39;m stay i am felt amazing place,this  hotel have natural view,wonderfull place,about service all staff hyatt regency very good,can help everything all i need.thanks"
"The Hyatt Regency Hotel is perfectly located thirty minutes from the centre of Yogyakarta.  Guests can enjoy the clean air and relax in beautifully kept pool and garden areas while still in close vicinity to major attractions.   Buffet breakfast The buffet breakfast came as part of the hotel package and was tremendous value. The buffet offered a range of foods from local Indonesian cuisine to individually made omelets.  The buffet also offered vegetarian options, fresh fruits and cakes.   Pool and Pool service  The only negative for this hotel would be the slowness of service around the pool area. My friend and I ordered lunch and had to wait at least an hour for food. The pool itself is amazing. The pool had different areas where children and adults could hang out and enjoy the</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed here for 3 nights in club room. Excellent place, value for money. The landscape around the hotel is very beautiful, if you have time, go for a jog for walk around it. Lots of variety on the breakfast buffet, out of the 3 days, they serve different variety of local breakfast. I arrived on a Saturday and straight away sign up for their Ramayana Ballet with Buffet dinner. I have never seen the real one but to me, this was good enough as an appreciation to this art. Enjoyed it. I have also taken ground tour from Angsa Tour which had a counter near the lobby. No complaints about that either. Price maybe on the high side but great service by the tour guide and driver. Take note there may be some restriction if you want to eat out."
"I love stay at Hyatt because fresh and lots of green view. In Addison to that I like the facility such as jogging track, swimming pool, golf area. I like also the quality of furniture and decoration. The food is good. The staff is very friendly."
Excellent hotel at Yogyakarta. Must try their Regency room for better and pleasant experience. Not to mentioned they provide complementary buffet for tea time with free flow of wine and beer when we are staying there.   We were amazed to be greeted by the Director himself during our stay and he was really humble and attentive to all issues highlighted by the guests.   Overall the hotel condition might seems a little old and about time for an upgrade but it is still comfortable to spent time at the hotel garden which still fits the hotel theme of having a touch of Prambanan and Borobudur monument.
I staying in this hotel for 6 days for business trip. The deluxe room is very great with very complete facilitates.. They also offering you very good environment with greens everywhereeee. The swimming pool is very great and fantastic! They also have really good services and delicious Indonesian or Western foods! :9
"absolutely stunning beauty around a perfect  well-run hotel, very nice 9 hole golf course in good condition with well-trained caddies.excellent food,good atmosphere,clean,good location for day trips,interesting performance on saturday night"
"Beautiful landscape, modern Javanese charming architecture, nice breakfast Buffett and good value . Small bed rooms and need to change the matrass and completely renovate the bathroom. Unfortunately the free andong ride is bad experience because the driver is lazy and unfriendly."
First I come feel so natural. With so many tree. Pool with mini river. Golf field and many other facilities. Location of this is about 5 km from city center but it&#39;s okay. Good breakfast and the bed is good. 2 night I stay and I have good sleep. 
"We stayed five nights at Hyatt Regency Yogjakarta. The stay was wonderful!  Service throughout our stay was overwhelming, as of course it should be at five star hotel. Facilities and rooms were well maintained, though going to need some renovations in near future (as the hotel is built in 90s).   The best thing about the Hyatt Regency Yogjakarta is its grounds. The hotel offers amazing pool area as well as golf course and restaurants on its grounds. The big lush green oasis was a perfect getaway from the traffic and chaos of the city.   For those visiting Borobudr or Merapi the Hyatt is excellent ground camp as the sights are on the that side of the city. Sure visiting at Prambanan or even beaches is not a problem. The traffic at Jogja, as everywhere in Indonesia, is quite</span><span>&hellip;"
"Overall a very pleasant stay.  The hotel is nice, if a bit old...the rooms could use an update.  Front Desk/Tour service, housekeeping, and general staff service all on par for what I&#39;d expect from a 5* resort... Pool is great and super fun for kids with a great water slide.  The gym is small but well equipped for cardio and weight training. Staff is really nice.  Great buffets with lots of yummy local food.  The efficiency of the F&amp;B service needs to be dramatically improved.   Service is extremely slow for any ala carte ordering, even for drinks only.  This applies to the Bistro, Poolside, and Bogeys Teras, and the Lobby Lounce.   The staff seem to be doing fine individually but management really needs to look at the overall system.   It seems that the only kitchen is in the</span><span>&hellip;"
We spend a full week in the Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta in July 2014. The hotel is located in a quite area about 15 minutes from the city center. It is a beautiful hotel with amazing grounds. There is a large pool split into several smaller pools at different levels which makes it very private with lots of small seating areas. The staff is fantastic: friendly and very helpful. The restaurant has a large outside seating area that is shaded by trees forming large natural umbrellas. The food is also nice with good variety.
"A whole day staying in a hotel is not bad after all, specially when we stay in Hyatt regency Yogyakarta. It&#39;s beautiful, quiet and cozy. Kids friendly also... Perfect place to hide away with your family..."
"One of the very best - a superb hotel spread on a vast expanse of land, beautiful gardens and surroundings, superb restaurant and food, impeccable service, and fantastic value for money. Exactly what a high quality hotel is expected to provide.  Highly recommended for travelers to Borabudur (less than an hour away)"
"We have stayed in the 18 years old Hyatt Regency Yogjakarta for the first time.After looking around in town we came to the conclusion like other visitors did before us , it is still the best hotel in   Yogjakarta from the vast areal of surrounding greens and golf course, until the big breakfast selection and evening buffet. We will be back anytime soon if time permits for the best hotel with nice pools also for the kids. Last but not least I would like to mention the dedicated service as well! "
"Stayed here almost every business visit in Yogyakarta. Service was great, but sometimes inconsistent when they have more guests than usual. One time I got sick during my stay and they brought me medicine, which was really helpful. I stick to this place as my preference stay since then. Great swimming pool, children would love it. The food for breakfast was good, it served Indonesian and Western food. "
"I stayed at this hotel with my husband and 21 year old daughter for a weekend. The hotel grounds are lovely, lush and clean. We stayed in a &quot;club&quot; room which I recommend as it includes complimentary drinks and substantial nibbles from 5- 7pm.  The room itself was well appointed, plush towels and fresh fruit provided daily.  The staff were all friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back to explore more of Yogyakarta.   Bogeys Terrace is a nice spot for a drink and meal as well, we only found this on our last day though."
"The hotel is just amazing, its 100% Hyatt service!  Great breakfast - one of the best I&#39;ve seen.  Great staff - they&#39;re ready to answer any question with an incredible friendliness. Comfortable rooms with a beautiful view. Take a room with a balcony otherwise you will not have a chance to open the window in a room. But with a balcony you can open a balcony door to get some fresh air.  We spent a great time there."
Here you can feel the warm of Indonesia ambience. Part of the huge gardens is decorated with candi-shaped stone. The staff is very helpful. The breakfast provides some Indonesian menu. Love it and will come back
"Going to yogyakarta?Hyatt should be your decision. A lot of new hotel opened, but in my opinon the best one is still Hyatt. You couldnt find the room with a good view, jogging track, golf course, mountain view, best food in the restaurant, especially the local and traditional one, excellent service. What else you want to find?everything about the best one is here already."
"We have stayed at Hyatt Regency Hotel for 4 nights 5 days, from 20 Feb 2015. The staff were very friendly n helpfull since the first day we arrived at the Hotel ,the room big enough can occupied 4 of us.the bathroom very clean.n they cleaned our rooms twice a day.The breafast was delicious n lots to choose.The Hotel provide free shuttlebus to Malioboro Theree lots of activities u can do at the hotel.bicycle ride, dokar ride n golf. I think Hyatt was the only hotel at Yogyakarta who had golf field.the swimming pool big too and our kids enjoy swam there."
We have been to several Hyatts and this was definitely one else hidden gem! I was taken aback by the beauty of the greens. We all know Hyatt for their fresh flowers and real plants and this Hyatt was superb. We were greater with a garland of jasmine flowers and their famous fruit punch and hot/cold towel. The reception was beautiful. I felt like I went back in time. The breakfast spread was huge and super delicious. The had a Ramayana show for dinner when we were there. The pool is stunning or shall I say pools. They have a little.pond that they all low guests to fish in for fun and a football wall for kids. A walk thru their gardens was truly breathtaking. Room had fresh flowers and fruits. The housekeeping team were really accommodating as with Front office and the Coffeehouse</span><span>&hellip;
"I stayed here for three nights in March swinging through on a business trip through Southeast Asia. The grounds are stunning: a huge, beautiful pool complex, a phenomenal view of Mt. Merapi and locally-inspired architecture. Dinner at the buffet was quite tasty and breakfast outside on the patio was a highlight.   All of which contributed to my surprise at the bare-bones nature of the room. It felt like they had simply run out of money when it came time to think about decorating their rooms. I don&#39;t even think mine had anything on the walls. Which doesn&#39;t matter much when you have such a phenomenal property. But still just seems off. "
"Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for 1 night and had a delightful experience. The hotel is located 15 minutes from the airport (without traffic). The grounds are lovely. We spent time relaxing outside with beautiful views of Mt Merapi next to the peaceful Koi pond. Kristri on reception was very helpful. Matea our waitress in the restaurant was very attentive and friendly and we really enjoyed the food which was reasonably priced. My favorite is pizza with double cheese ! Nila on guest service, she was very helpful, friendly and pleasant. She made arrangements for us to go to Borobudur Temple within an hour of arrival. The driver spoke very little English but he was a careful driver.Swimming pool was great . Clean , and relax. Overall, this property is great and I will</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel is quite far from anything but the swimming pool is why we went and it is great. You really can spend hours just in the pool. We were a little disappointed with the breakfast as most of the items were Indonesian or Chinese and we weren&#39;t familiar with them. A bit more explanation of the local foods would have been helpful. The dishes from the menu were fantastic though.  We had a bit of an issue with our room booking. We arrived late because our plane was delayed. As a result our 2 year old was in a horrible mood and was exhausted. Even though the staff saw the state he was in they had us fill out a bunch of paperwork right then, more than we filled out anywhere else on our trip. The woman also made some mention of a membership that she would fill out for us for free</span><span>&hellip;"
We stayed for 4 nights and absolutely enjoyed every moment of our stay. The staff extremely friendly and assist with all our requirements. My wife is Vegan vegetarian and they went out of the way to provide for her food orders.  Will be recommending this resorr all my family and friends. 
"I was really impressed with how beautiful this hotel and its grounds were. Everything is top class, including a great multilevel pool. Room was really nice too. Also excellent, and very friendly, was the service. I had an issue with my boarding pass and they really went out of their way to help. One minor criticism is the restaurant, which is attractive with attentive service but, frankly, not the greatest food. Actually no where I ate in Yogyakarta was all that good. Anyway, this is the perfect place to stay if you want to visit the truly awesome Borobudur site!"
"The rooms may be small for a five star hotel, but there is nothing like the lush gardens golf course and expansive swimming pool. You can take an early morning walk or jog on the well demarcated paths before you start your sight seeing or business meetings. The cuisine is excellent with varieties each day. There is a shuttle to the tourist centre in down town jogja - the famous malioboro.   There are no balconies at least in most rooms. that would have been a plus for luxury facility."
"We loved this hotel.  We got a fantastic deal on Agoda and rented connecting rooms.. 1 king and 1 set of twins.... Both nicely appointed.  Tile baths could be a bit more &quot;upscale&quot; to line up with the lobby and grounds offered, but absolutely fine and spotlessly clean- and the price was so good, I can&#39;t really complain.  It&#39;s perfectly located- Close to Yogya, but out of craziness, close to Prambadan, easy drive to Borobudur (but if you want to see the sunrise- rent a hotel near Borobudur). Just a short drive to Merapi! The grounds are lovely, a nice break from Jakarta. The pool has a giant slide for the kids set in a &quot;temple&quot; theme... Although it&#39;s only 1 slide, my kids could ride it all day.  We also loved the waterfall at the pool and winding around to all the different pool</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed at the Hyatt in a Club room for 4 nights. The hotel is not central, but has a shuttle bus service into the centre of Yogyakarta. If you are planning to visit Borobudur Temple and Prambanam Temple Complex, you will be able to do so by booking a tour direct from the tour agencies situated in the lobby area of the hotel. Our room was very good with an effective air conditioner and powerful shower. It was very useful that on request the hotel will provide a dehumidifier as humidity in Yogyakarta can get as high as 80%!  The club facilities were adequate and good value for money, we enjoyed in particular the freshly squeezed local orange juice and cappuccinos! The staff at the Club were very courteous and friendly, special thanks to Lita Chabel and Andreas for making our</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for 3 nights and had a delightful experience. The hotel is located 15 minutes from the airport (without traffic). We had booked a club room, hence our check-in/out were handled at the club lounge desk. Upon checking in, guests are provided with a cold wet hand towel and a refreshing drink. Our room was a good sized one, with a view of the gardens and the golf course and had a spacious bathroom with a bathtub and shower. The standard amenities were provided in the room including plenty of bottled water.  The hotel has the Kemangi Bistro as its main restaurant on site, which has a limited but fantastic menu. We tried local as well as western dishes and were very pleased with the quality of the food. The food does take 15-20 minutes to arrive</span><span>&hellip;"
What a relaxing stay we had at the Hyatt.  We were there for just one night but I wished we had stayed here for all 3 of our nights in the area instead of staying 2 near Borobudur. The grounds are lovely.  We spent time relaxing outside with beautiful views of Mt Merapi next to the peaceful Koi pond.  We stayed in one of the executive club rooms and enjoyed breakfast and evening cocktails and appetizers in the lounge...totally worth the extra money for us.  The room was a nice size and quiet.  Bed was comfy.  We liked that there was a separate shower and tub in the bathroom.  We loved the food in the restaurant and felt it was reasonably price.  We were there on a Saturday night during the rainy season so we took advantage of watching their Ramayana ballet performance outside</span><span>&hellip;
"Very good hotel! I loved it! The pool was great, the hotel itself, the other activities (golf, tennis, etc.) were all awesome and great! I would definitely go again. There were some flaws though. The food was cold, especially in buffets, and the beds were hard. Everything else was absolutely exceptional. If you ever go to Yogyakarta, go to the Hyatt Regency."
The jasmine leis are a lovely welcoming touch on arrival.We had a standard room at an excellent rate which was very comfortable as was the bed. Wifi in the room worked well. Ratna on reception was very helpful in arranging for a cake and flowers for a celebration of our 43rd wedding anniversary which were beautiful and presented to me at the restaurant. Ana our waitress in the restaurant was very attentive and friendly and we really enjoyed the food which was reasonably priced.The hotel is set in beautifully landscaped grounds with the most wonderful swimming pools. We were there during Chinese New Year and we could still find a quiet part to swim in.The golf course is also priced at a very good rate. There is a free shuttle down to Malioboro in the town which took about 15 mins</span><span>&hellip;
"My husband and I stayed in this hotel in Valentine day...we took the standard room with garden view..we loved the view from our room,with a wide glass viewing a large and beautiful garden..the room had everything,bathroom with bath tub and hair dryer,a wide LCD,etc...the bed was comfortable...the breakfast had various menu from eastern to western..the staff was so friendly and helpful...we could choose breakfast in indoor or outdoor with a great view to the pool..the atmosphere was soothing...well all worth it to the price...we will surely back to this hotel."
"I was astonished with how reasonable the rates are at this hotel during the off-season. Location is a few kilometres north of the main city area, but it has the benefit of being a proper resort without traffic noise problems. The grounds are beautiful and from what I could see of the golf course, that also looked pretty good. Only 1 restaurant but if you arrange your own car and driver that shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Service was great. The room itself was fairly average but with a pleasant view over the gardens. On the negative side: quite a lot of noise from slamming doors in the corridor early in the morning (presumably so people could go off and play golf), the (admittedly free) wifi was troublesome and it was necessary to keep reconnecting, and the drain in the combined shower</span><span>&hellip;"
"As soon as we got out of our vehicle (we were met by the hotel driver), we were greeted with fragrant Jasmine leis.  Checking in was a breeze since we were SPG members and they had a special desk for SPG members.  We were told that we could eat breakfast as soon as we have rested.  We went ahead and checked our room then got a quick breakfast.  The safe in the room was not working so I called.  The staff from the Engineering Department came right away and replaced the safe. Our initial contact person was Yayon.  She was very helpful, friendly and pleasant.  She made arrangements for us to go to Borobudur Temple within an hour of arrival.  The driver spoke very little English but he was a careful driver.  On our first evening, we were treated to an elaborate welcome cocktail</span><span>&hellip;"
"I was surprised whenc chcking in at Hyatt Yogyakarta, it was beautifully lanscaped, and most imporatntly for me as a golfer is that they have a golf course in their back yard. The room is not so big but it was clean and neat. The breakfast was ranging from Indonesian to western and continental breakfast. i will definetley come back to stay and play golf in the future."
"In overall, my experience of staying 2-nights in this hotel was good. However, I only gave an &quot;average&quot; score because regardless of their good service, I expected them to perform better to reflect the 5-stars status of this hotel. The hotel ground was superb and it is suitable for those who are looking a tranquil hideaway, out of the busy city of Yogyakarta, but yet can still reach the city center in only 30 min driving. My first night was great, however i am a little disappointed when on the second day I found that the used amenities in my room were not being replaced or supplied with the new one. Whenever I stayed in other 5-stars hotels, they always replace (or put new supply) of amenities on the second, third, and whatever next nights when the guest stayed. I was running out</span><span>&hellip;"
"We really enjoyed the Hyatt Hotel, the Hotel and hotel grounds are beautiful and the room  was comfortable and clean with nice beds (our room had a beautiful view of the garden). We were welcomed at the Hotel by two beautiful charming ladies with nice smelling flowers and felt very special. The breakfast and dinner was really good, in food quality and service. The service of our waitress(she was gracious and beautiful) was the best I ever got in our 20 years plus of traveling. One of the biggest assets of the Hotel are their employees! We strongly recommend this Hotel"
"We came from a noisy and busy city to Yogua to get rid of the crowd for 3D2N and we were able to sit back and fully relax at such a nice hotel.There are many big or small swimming pools outside the hotel for adults, family or kits. We had an enjoyable breakfast and impresive dinner as the hotel restaurant is noted its excellent cuisine. After tours to the famous Borobudur Temple, Prambana Temple and Parangtiritis Beach, a spa at the hotel is recommended but advance booking is required.  Last but not the lease, staff are helpful and friendly."
"We stayed for 3 nights at this property and we really enjoyed, the hotel grounds are beautiful and the rooms are a bit worn out but still comfortable and clean with nice beds! We had breakfast and lunch at the hotel and everything was really good, from the service to the quality and the price. But the best of this hotel is its staff, everyone is very nice and friendly. They also provide a shuttle to Malioboro street which comes in handy. If your flight is early morning you can request a breakfast box. My friends also tried the spa and loved it! Overall a great property in a great city!"
Very nice hotel with vast amount of greenery and a 9 hole golf course. Close by to a really good &quot;warung pecel&quot; (Indonesian salad). The room is quite big and nice and all  you can expect from a 5 star hotel including the service.
"It was good experience while staying in this hotel.With a charm staff,we were guided to the check in area.Very good ambience sourrounding this hotel.Through the room with a big window we can see the beautiful view.Breakfast is also good with many varieties.You can meet traditional culture of Jogja with a touch of modernization."
"Beautiful hotel with magnificent grounds - the multiple pools, water slide and surrounding gardens are beautifully designed, all in keeping with the ancient ruins &#39;Borobudur&quot; theme. Staff are friendly and helpful and buffet breakfast has great combination of local fare and Western favorites. Free andong rides, excellent massages and Ramayana performances add to the charm of this great hotel. Exceptionally good value for money - would highly recommend Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta."
"It&#39;the second time I chose this jotel during my staying in yogyakarta,and it feels like being in heaven! The room is very clean,with fruit on the table.The service is very professional,I cannot complain at all about the personnel and you definitely have to try indonesian massage (2h one),you will never regret!the sorrounding field is something I have never seen,after a long business trip is the only place I want to be!breakfast has lot of variety.there is also a shuttle which goes to the centre"
"We were there a week ago for three nights , the hotel was very good , clean, and nice location,... The only things is the bathroom without normal shower...?? How can be in a five star hotel? And restaurant closed at 10 p.m how can be in a five star hotel??"
"recently, I visited this hotel twice and while it might be aging a little I remain impressed with the landscaping, the service and the facilities. Excellent place to visit with kids, they like the swimming pool and the breakfast buffet which is abundant and of good quality"
"Very good impression when you arrive! Nice entrance, friendly teams, great view on the golf course.  Good breakfast!  That&#39;s it! Rooms are simply depressing! Old, old, old... The rest of the hotel can be nice but let me remind you (if it was necessary) that the most important feature of a hotel is its rooms... I am not gonna sleep at the pool or on the lovely grass of the golf course. I will sleep in the bedroom, take my shower in the bathroom and spend minimum 35% of my day n night in the room! One more thing: Hyatt is certainly one of the last of its species to still charge for internet in your room...  Not recommended!"
"A well set hotel, that provides good care to its guests. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Good service. The choice of vegetarian spread is very limited. Perhaps that can be the only blemish, if at all. The hotel is set inside from the main road, and is peaceful. A wide verity of activities Golf, tennis etc, available."
"You can tell that this hotel was the bomb about ten years ago, and it is still very nice, but starting to show its age.  It is maintained pretty well, but will soon need a complete renovation if the owners want it to remain a deluxe Hyatt resort.  The rooms are clean, but a little worn.  The grounds around the resort are gorgeous.  The pool is great, but needs a little renovation as well.  As it is, it is a very good hotel that used to be a super fancy, high end hotel.  I would not hesitate to stay here again if the price is good ($100 USD/night or less).  If they do a complete renovation, expect it to be 3x that price."
"the Hyatt Regency Yogja doesnot hold a candle to the other Hyatt properties around the world. It needs a renovation today and many facilities are non-existence. the only reason i have given them a &quot;very good&quot; review is because most of the staff there is genuinely helpful and the property itself is beautiful with its open lush lawns, water features and borobudur inspired architect  Positives: 1. beautiful property 2. genuinely affectionate staff and extremely helpful 3. they gave me a complimentary cake for my birthday (which my husband organised) but also showered me with beautiful bouquets of flowers and cards (which my husband did not organise and says should have taken the credit for anyways)  4. great setting for the ramayana ballet 5. free wifi  not so positive: 1. the</span><span>&hellip;"
"However it wasn&#39;t that great. I stayed with my mum and sister for 2 nights during the new year holiday. Indeed it is a good hotel with great facilities such as swimming pool, pond, jogging track, andong (horse cart) touring, outbound activities for family, etc. I had fun swimming and sunbathing in their pool.  But I must say that their service isn&#39;t great. First, they didn&#39;t give us any info to book the andong village tour. When I ask about it they just said that I can go directly to ball desk and wait for it there. They should&#39;ve told me that I need to book the tour by giving them the hour I wanna do the andong tour and my room number :/  Second, during the breakfast buffet. I have the feeling they lack of staff for the holiday season as I almost got into a fight to get nasi</span><span>&hellip;"
"We recently visited Jogjakarta to see the sites, and stayed at the Hyatt Regency.  It is a nice hotel, with good facilities - nice pool area, green open spaces, golf course. However the service is poor. The staff, whilst friendly, are slow and inattentive. The restaurants have potential, as the food is tasty - but almost every meal we ate arrived cold. We paid for the Club Rooms, which gave access to the Club Lounge which is definitely a good option, but the staffing in the Club Lounge are ineffectual to issues raised. The Club Rooms are nice, with access to the grounds, and breakfast is good. Generally a decent option within Jogja, but management need to seriously look at their staffing."
"Staying this hotel for 3 consecutive nights, this hotel was very nice to stay. Garden and Golf-Field was very wide to explore. Jogging track quite distance and very nice to try.  Although the building seemed not new (I thought this was build in 80&#39;s-90&#39;s), but kept well. Very clean and was memorable to stay in this hotel. Couple years ago, traffic this hotel was not too crowded, but nowadays, as traffic increased, trapped in traffic lights, force us to take some time to reach into this hotel. Try to swim at pool and feel the difference..  Food also good in general. Vary for vegetarian to normal breakfast. Very recommend to stay to this hotel."
"What a pleasure to see a resort hotel and its staff to step up to social responsibility and support a noble cause such as Brest Cancer awareness.   The work that was put forth by directors and entire staff of Hyatt to organize and support the two days Pink Ribbon event was extremely touching.   There were awareness speeches, fashion show and a fantastic dance completion by local children.   The competition was kicked off by GM of Hyatt and its directors doing an impromptu Dane themselves which received lot of applause and laughter.    The Hyatt team raised a lot of awareness and funds for a very worthy cause.  Love your women and save them.    This is what makes living  in Hyatt worth it! "
"I have stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta many times and we have used it for VIP guests as well, always to our satisfaction. As well we have often hosted small to medium size high level conferences there. The hotel&#39;s location and design are quite breathtaking - in the northern part of the city with superb views of Mt Merapi and surrounded by greenery thanks to its 9 hole golf course. The design is inspired by the famous Borobudur Buddhist temple, and rises in concentric levels but it is small in scale. It has easy access to the centre of the city (20 minutes).  On the main road in front of the hotel has grown up an excellent &quot;restaurant row&quot; - so within a a few hundred meters are many new restaurants which staff can recommend to you. Off hand, I can recommend IBC (family</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed here for 2 nights - not long enough. The location is relatively far from the city center, but you get the tranquility and the view. It&#39;s only 30 minute drive from the airport. All guests are.given a fragrant jasmine garland upon arrival. Walking to the lobby you will be treated with a beautiful view of Mt Merapi. The hotel&#39;s premise is huge. It has a golf course, swimming pool and spa, separate building for conference &amp; meeting rooms.  The room is relatively small compared to other new 5* hotels&#39; and the furnitures are dated. But the room is very clean, well maintained. The bathroom is clean and nice. The bed is very comfortable and there are plenty of pillows. Breakfast was fantastic. So many sumptuous choices: local and western, healthy and otherwise, great selection</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel not only has very nice view to Merapi mountain but also has large garden and golf course. Choose the North side of room is better, because we can directly see Merapi mountain.  Breakfast is excellent, a lot of choice"
"Set in stunning surroundings, this could become a really nice hotel if only they spent a bit more money in smartening up the rooms and restaurants.  What I liked: 1. Very nice staff. Great service with a smile. 2. Beautiful premises. Great looking gardens, lush golf course, long and winding pool. 3. Quiet surroundings and the comfortable bed made for great sleep quality.   What was not so great: 1. Average quality of food. Breakfast buffet had a wide spread, but nothing stood out. Likewise the a la carte options. 2. Rooms were a bit dated and tired. The bathroom and furnishings need freshening up.  What I did not like: 1. Location. Away from town, nothing of interest nearby. 2. Beautiful pool, but dirty on both occasions I ventured for a swim. 3. Patchy wifi connectivity in the</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed for 2 nights at Hyatt and its a nice hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. At the restaurant we were treated royally. The service is superb! Since we are vegetarians, we explained what we could have and the staff &amp; chef came up with some tasty options. The rooms could have been a little bigger and they look a little worn out. But considering Jogja, it is one of the good properties to stay. Overall, we had a good experience staying in this hotel."
"This is our second time stay in Hyatt Jogja... And expected, everything is perfect from the time we enter the hotel until the last minutes ... Kids love the pool, the fishing pond and cycling the golf area.  We take the club room free access to the club area and afternoon coctail.  Breakfast and dinner are served very well with wide variety of local and international menu  Staff are very helpfull and they take care my kids very well.  "
"I never been to this property before and yet they treated me like I was their long-time-no-see friend. I was impressed by their flexibility and their agility on handling all my needs. Their property was built in 1997, although their property seems old, but the atmosphere was spot-on. It was so unfortunate I didnt bring my family along because this property will be a great place to have a quality time with your family. Foods were excellent. They have lagoon pool, it will fit for those with kids. They also have a 9-hole golf resort, you can rent golf sticks and it&#39;s affordable. One thing that bugging me was that their internet connectivity is come and go and you have to pay extra to get high-speed connection. But overall, this property is great and I will definitely go back.  "
"I really like this hotel, a comfortable and green hotel with touch of traditional heritage of Java. There&#39;s facility of andong and bicycle from and around hotel. The food is quite good and the weather is beautiful here."
"I stayed for 3 nights at Hyatt Yogyakarta during company conference.   The hotel is very big and has many facilities; swimming pool, fitnes center, spa and even golf.  The room was ok and amenities were fine.  Staffs were helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was good with a lot of varieties.  However, I can tell that the hotel is showing its age.  Bedsheet was not clean and had some stain, bed was not comfortable and hard.  Water pressure was not good and hot water was sometimes not working during my stay.  Bathtub was old style and very slippery.  They should consider removing the bathtub, or at least put a mat.  It were so dangerous, I almost felt whenever I showered.  Hyatt Yogyakarta was definetely very grand in the past.  However, I would not consider it, if I visit Yogyakarta</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed at the Hyatt for a week and a half.  I&#39;d originally tried to make a reservation for my entire 5-week stay, but I&#39;m actually glad they didn&#39;t have space.  Pros:  The staff were extremely nice, without a doubt the best part of my stay.  They really made me feel very welcome, to the point that I feel terrible for writing a negative review.  The manager, Nur, went out of his way to sit down with me and recommend places to visit in the area.  Other members of the staff were also really, really nice.    The landscaping was beautiful.  If you&#39;re looking for a relaxing oasis from the loud, dirty city, you definitely feel that when you get to the hotel.  In the room, the bed was really comfortable.  Though the hotel was fully booked on many of the days I was there, I never</span><span>&hellip;"
"Went on a Mother and daughters trip . 3 of us had super fun holiday . The Staffs were extremely friendly and kind.   The staffs at the regency club floor were efficient and kind   The food at restaurant were delicious and good deal . ( If compare to Singapore ) . Breakfast had lots of variety for you to enjoy .  Swimming pool was great . Clean , and relax."
"Such a beautiful hotel built like Borobudur and with little stupas dotting the entrance. Has a tranquil and serene ambience with lotus flowers blooming. We were checked into the club regency rooms within five minutes. But we had to wait for two rooms out of the four to be vacated as the guests had not left on time. I was given an apology letter for that. They welcome you with Jasmine garlands and welcome drink in the Club Regency.  All four rooms had good views with two of swimming pool and garden and the other two had golf course views. Both were interconnecting rooms. Delicious snacks are served in the cocktail time in the evening.  The breakfast is sumptuous with Indonesian, Chinese and Continental food.  As our flight landed at 10.30am from Denpasar and check-in is at 3pm,</span><span>&hellip;"
"First staff were universally very good and committed to guest experience being positive , beyond this the guest experience was surprisingly and disappointingly poor.  Room was permeated by musty odour which rendered unpleasant to stay in, also infestation with small ants. Wi-fi to weak signal to use for any meaningful work in rooms.  Al-la- cart service from the kitchen at dinner was  grim, bread reaching &quot;maturity&quot; butter straight from freezer, overuse of garlic and chili rendered simple menu choices (cream soup steak and chips) a ghastly experience. No care and attention from the chefs, and this may in part be due to wedding and other functions sucking up all the effort, either way lack of quality control and supervision (waiting staff were good) Breakfast was curtailed when</span><span>&hellip;"
"I have been there right after such a productive business trip purpose in Semarang. 4 hours over the land trip was paid off once I decided to check in at Hyatt Regency.  The ancient arcithecture of the well-known Borobudur statue is a thing that catched-up my attention the most. Greenery was there to get your eyes relaxed and so is your feeling. Rooms, staff, and the early check-in process was a real smooth. I swam and enjoyed all the greens by walking around the resort. I loved the breakfast and I think it should be a little nicer to improve some menus in the buffet breakfast.  Overall, my Jogja experience is best with Hyatt!"
Arriving late and then only staying one night is a shame in this beautiful hotel. Being welcomed with a Yasmin necklace has been a nice touch being on a business trip.   Staying there for a one day event in the hotel was nice. The room was spacious with a great view into the park. The restaurant looks over the pool and depending on the weather you can sit inside or outside.   The food was excellent and the Internet connection sufficiently fast to get some work done. Wish I could have stayed a bit longer.
"The hotel is super clean and well maintained, even by Western standards.  The Pool is where this hotel really stands out -- waterslides, basketball, great lounge chairs, bar service, etc.  The club level rooms are great.  Free coffee, snacks and happy hour along with an amazing breakfast buffet.  For other amenities, there is a gym but it&#39;s a bit small.  Golf and other activities look great but I&#39;m not sure who can stand to enjoy these activities in 95 degree humid Indonesian weather.  The Spa / Locker room feels (smells...) a bit dirty.  The massages offered here are ok, not great.  More of the relaxing style than deep tissue stress relief.  I ate at the hotel several times.  The food here is good, not great.  The staff at the cafes are very friendly and make an effort to learn</span><span>&hellip;"
"We booked a Club room and when we arrived, we were escorted to the Club Lounge and were quickly checked-in. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The hotel has a real big pool with a water slide which the kids loved. Rooms are clean and doesn&#39;t look as old as what some reviews say. Within the hotel, there is a travel agent that provide very reasonable rate to hire a car with driver to go wherever you want. Massages at the spa was good and at very reasonable prices too. Must visit Prabanam and Borobudor."
"Hyatt was one of the top choice for hotel in jogjakarta for my big family. My uncle and cousin usually stay at hyatt during their holiday in Jogjakarta. But I never go there until last August.  I must say that they have one of the most unique welcome ceremony in jogjakarta, you will be greeted with flower necklace put on you by their friendly employee. Welcome drink and warm towel also provided. It was very nice experience.  They also offer program like cooking class for those who want to fill their holiday with unique things to do. They have several pools also, quite nice for kids.   One thing though, i guess part of the room need refreshment, otherwise it could be easily 5 stars."
"I usually stay this hotel. The room is nice and well maintained always. Especially bed Linen is very comfortable. They have a lot of facilities such as golf course,tennis with instructor,spa,big pool. The restaurant also serve us nice meal.My favorite is pizza with double cheese !   Finally, let me nominate Ms.CITRA (at restaurant) for a best staff awards at this hotel. She always serve promptly and catch what I need.  I appreciate your service spirits !  Check in_Oct,28 - out Oct,31,2014"
"The hotel staff really makes you feel special! When we arrived we were greeted with flower leis, cold drinks and towels. The purpose of our visit was to see the Borobudur Temple which the hotel arranged for us. Our guide as really great and we would highly recommend! We did the half day city tour one day - which was really interesting and informative. Then the next day the same guide took us to Borobudur (which is about an hour drive). We are so happy that we had the hotel arrange this for us. The pool is gigantic as were the grounds. There are beautiful trees and flowers everywhere you looked. The breakfast was plentiful and would suit everyones needs. We ate dinner here a few times as well and the food was really good and not terribly expensive. The room was a nice size and</span><span>&hellip;"
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights and honestly almost everything was amazing! The atmosphere everywhere in the hotel is great, the garden and swimming pools are a real paradise, the breakfast is overwhelming and very good, the dinner location is very romantic under the trees and the food is very good. The room we had was big, luxury, comfortable, clean and had great views at the garden. The staff was very friendly and helpful. From the moment we entered the hotel we felt at home and totally relaxed. The only room for improvement we see is the spa. The treatments we had were okay, but not in line with the rest of the hotel and the spa itself looks a bit outdated and also not in line with the rest of the hotel. We would definetely recommend this hotel to others, we</span><span>&hellip;"
"I would have never dreamed I&#39;d give a Hyatt property 5 stars but this one is a real gem. This hotel was utterly fabulous from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. In fairness  I haven‚Äôt stayed at more than a dozen Hyatt‚Äôs but they&#39;ve rarely surpassed 3 stars in my opinion. This property is gorgeous. It is a phenomenal blend of historic, traditional and contemporary architecture, landscaping, design, decor and furnishing. Each and every staff member we interacted with was nothing short of spectacular. Everyone was very polite, attentive, helpful, engaging and friendly. Concierge, greeters, security, club staff, bellman, housekeeping, valet, restaurant staff, business center &amp; manager were all wonderful. They made us feel very welcome and appreciated. Special. My wife &amp;</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed at Hyatt Regency Yogya for 2 nights as we attended training. The Hyatt Regency land area is huge and connected to golf course at the back of the hotel. We had a plesant stay and the service is superb. The meeting room is also good. However we want to suggest that the food spread for breakfast and lunch need to be improved by adding more varieties. Lastly, we noted that in some outdoor areas the mosquitos are quiet a lot and i am sure that the management of the hotel has done something to it. Perhaps regular spray can be added. Cheers"
"Every staff member at the hotel is delightfully genuine in wanting to help &amp; ensure guests have a fabulous visit.  The Club Rooms are stunning value, although we moved up to a (slightly) smaller 6th floor room with private terrace at no extra charge. Long breakfasts beside the pool.  A delightfully jumbled pool with lots of spots to get away from everybody else.  Awesome spa treatments. The bursts of Japanese tour groups were barely a blip disturbing the overall peace &amp; tranquility."
"Clean, well maintained hotel with lots of activities for couples, kids and family. Resort has several activities to keep you within their walls such as football, golf, climbing, wall soccer, cycling etc. Free ride to malioboro street but avoid it by all means, boring shopping street. Rooms lacked a shower cabin.  Spa was awesome and restaurant has several varieties. It is everything you would expect from a star resort. Looking for a safe branded option for your holiday is your kinds, then you would love this."
"This Hyatt Regency is really an amazing and complete resort. Located on the main road that leads to the slope of Mt. Merapi, which one of the most active volcanoes in the world, it is only approximately 45 minutes away from the world renowned, UNESCO World Heritage Site, Borobudur and Prambanan Temple complexes. The Yogyakarta Kraton / Palace located in downtown is only 15 minutes drive away. I love everything about this resort...... the well manicured gardens, the architecture (the main hotel building is build to mimick the famous Borobudur Temple), the pools, golf course, and most of all, the professional and utterly charming staff and the services they rendered. Guest room is the not the biggest nor boast the most up to date decor but has all the necessary amenities. It is</span><span>&hellip;"
"In the chaotic atmosphere of Yogya, with its trillion motorcycles, the HR is a welcoming enclave of peaceful quietness and luxury. Somewhat classic business hotel, still nice for a short family, vacation stay on your way to other destinations. Good traditional rooms. Good restaurant. Nice swimming pool. And a good base camp to visti Borobudur, Prambanan and the city centre."
"It is a Javanese themed resort hotel all under one roof; swimming pool for grown-ups &amp; kids, 9-hole golf course, Spa wellness centre, local tour &amp; a lushful garden picturesque. The staffs are very friendly &amp; helpful not to mention especially the asst. Front Desk manager Pak Yanuar &amp; his staff Ms. Sus. The tour desk is very helpful &amp; knowledgeable too. The rooms are okay, but a bit small compared to other Hyatt hotels in Indonesia. Breakfast is superb, must try the pancakes &amp; waffles. Every Saturday night, there is a Ramayana arts performance at the hotel  grounds with buffet dinner. Wonderful event and lighting &amp; surroundings. Very special and worth the money. A must try experience. Will stay in the hotel again if ever have the chance to visit Yogyakarta again."
"We loved this hotel&#39;s Borobudur-style look. It has an amazing, beautiful park with big pools, really beautiful &amp; relaxing, looking really exotic, with the big red fish swimming in the pond and jasmin necklaces as a welcome gift.  It was not booked out as we were their, so the pools (with a small waterfall!) were almost empty and we spent a lot of time swimming. The service is absolutely great, with very friendly staff who even helped to add TV channels tso that we could watch the world cup in our own room. There&#39;s a lot of little extras - like a free shuttle to the city centre, live music in the hall, a free horse trip, etc. Every evening we went out of the hotel to eat in the small local caf√©s - cheap &amp; delicious. We&#39;d definitely rebook this Hyatt any time."
"My family of 5 members stayed at Hyatt, Yogyakarta for 3 nights. We booked 2 connecting rooms  (a king  and a double bed). The rooms are clean and average size suitable for maximum of 2 adults per room. What I love about the hotel is the beautiful landscape and greenery surrounding the hotel. The staff are also warm and helpful. The food is good too. "
"Well, of course room is the main thing being offered by hotels but if you&#39;re looking forward to in-house facility that allows you to relax in the shade by the pool, Hyatt offers the best pool in town. For peace seekers, make sure you not relaxing by the pool brunch-lunch time in Sundays because that are when Hyatt&#39;s pool packed with families (and kids). They open the swimming pool for public, charging no less than 100.000, but in Sundays they offer brunch for 160&#39;sK/pax plus swimming.   I personally love their pastries, and the lounge next to the lobby offers affordable snacks and beverages for a 5 star hotel.   Now, the room, not the best quality, the tub drain was clogged but I did not complain, so they did not know, so no action taken to fix this, thus I shouldn&#39;t be</span><span>&hellip;"
"My second stay at Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta, without being my favourite hotel in Indonesia it does come in my top 5 - everything is to like about this hotel, it is a Hyatt and  from the well appointed rooms, with quality linen  , good food and beverage and trained friendly staff that remember you name, not only ones on the reception desk but also wait staff in the restaurant, Hyatt training and it shows . Number one point about this hotel for me is the beautiful architecture and the spacious garden setting really prepares you if you are planning on visiting Borobudur , you can really forget that you are in the city as you relax under the tress and take in the parkland setting and 9 hole golf course. Breakfast is good to without being as good as Grand Hyatt in Jakarta it is more</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is a great place to stay, people are extremely friendly and your stay will be relaxing. The Hotel restuarant was also fantastic with good variety of local crusine. The breakfast spread is also worth enjoying. We also enjoyed the complimentary horse ride through the adjacent village.  Definately recommended for a relaxing fun filled stay."
"Last August 2014 was not my first visit but the hotel still looks professionally maintained even though it was considered quite old. Other competitors are poorly managed. The room was outstanding, food was great (breakfast and group lunch), senior management were very helpful and responsible, Nice experience and the group members also like it."
"I stayed two nights at this hotel while visiting Yogyakarta.  The grounds around the hotel are spectacular: large, well maintained garden, well-designed pool space that is relatively peaceful even when crowded. Large grounds including a golf course and tennis courts. Definitely the highlight of the hotel. The loby and public spaces are actually also nice, looking fresh and luxurious.   The rooms, on the other hand, were extremely disappointing, reminding me of a 2-3 stars hotel rather than a luxury resort. Besides the bed, that is actually very confortable, everything else is falling apart: faucet leaking water, dirty yellowish shower curtain (who still uses shower curtains anyway?), questionable cleanliness (hair in the bathtub), and an overall feeling of aged rooms in dire</span><span>&hellip;"
"I know the hotel since more than 10 years and come back almost each year. The warm and friendly welcome can&#39;t be discribed in words and I feel home from the first minute I step out of the car. I agree with some of the writers before, the hotel becomes older and you can see it in small details. Also the design and the functionality of the room interior isn&#39;t up to date. BUT all of this minor blemish not really disturbing. The charme of this hotel is definitely the great location within the big garden area and the unbelivable service of the hotel staff. The hotel offers a wide range of activities for all of the family members (free carriage ride, free kids club,....). The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to and from the city. The club room provides daily food between 5 pm</span><span>&hellip;"
"In a toss up between the Phoenix and the Hyatt, we chose Hyatt for the price and the spacious grounds. But, after our stay, I can confidently say that I would choose it again for its gracious service and the relaxing ambience.  The people really make this hotel. The head chef made special dishes for us when he knew that we were vegetarian and had limited choice in the breakfast buffet (which, mind you, was more than enough!). All the people in the hotel, including even the lawn cleaners, always had a smile. And, the Regency Club desk even helped us make reservations in Gajah Wong, a restaurant in town.  With all this attention, the room becomes secondary. It was a bit tired and worn down in fixtures. And, we had to look at three rooms before agreeing to one which had more</span><span>&hellip;"
"I loved this hotel. The staff are so friendly. Cleaners did a good job. The rooms are a bit retro but to me, this gives the place charm. We stayed for three nights and, being a celiac, the head caterer made sure that my meals were gluten free. The breakfast had an extensive range of food to choose from, and the evening meals were delicious. The only hiccup was we requested weeks prior to arriving a Merapi view with balcony. When we checked in they told us the only room available was a second floor garden view room without balcony. But with a bit of rearranging the staff gave us another room on the seventh floor with lovely view of the golf course and palm trees. Nice and quiet with huge balcony.... Besides, when we stayed it was too misty to see mt merapi from the room, so we</span><span>&hellip;"
"Most of the reviews encapsulate how good this hotel is. Granted the rooms aren&#39;t as modern as some would like, but they are very comfortable with all modern amenities. I did find the british plugs odd, however an adapter was provided.  Breakfast buffet was included, and also excellent. Eating by the pool, surrounded by lush greenery and eating great food? For ~$100 a night? come on!   For a nice yet cost effective dinner, check out Gadjah Wong on JL. Gejayan Soropadan 79-D, Sleman."
I stayed here with my family of 5 for a six night stay. My wife is diamond with Hyatt and we booked two connecting rooms. Our stay was during Hari Raya so please take this into consideration when reading my review.  The Good The hotel grounds are outstanding! They really brought in the culture of the temples near yogyakarta to the hotel. My kids loved the pool slide and tempe they can to climb to get to the top of the slide. There were plently of other small pools which provide enough space between where the kids played and pools were adults could relax in.  The value of this hotel was great considering what was provided. At around $70/night I felt that you got significant value for what was offered.  The breakfeast selection was expansive and you could receive pork bacon upon</span><span>&hellip;
"(Posted this also as a review under the Phoenix Hotel)  Can&#39;t decide of the 2 hotels to stay at?  I couldn&#39;t either, so I stayed at both. Hope this helps you decide.   Both the Phoenix (P) and Hyatt Regency (HR) are about the same price, at least when I went, September 2014. At the HR as I write this.   Both hotels are very nice. The P double room is a good size room, but smaller than the equivalent at the HR. The advantage of the P is that it&#39;s close to the center of town. You can walk to Malioboro and next to a McDonalds and KFC. The HR however is much further out with not much around, but taxis are cheap and the HR has a free shuttle to Malioboro during the day.   The P provides free wifi throughout the hotel, while HR has it free in the public areas, but you can pay for</span><span>&hellip;"
"The Hotel location is just great, The staffs are friendly, but unfortunately the service is a bit slow, and the room was not cleaned properly. Bath towels are often looked unclean, and bedsheets too!."
"We&#39;ve been staying 12x in 12 years for holiday from Europe. I think that speaks for itself. This place is like our 2nd home:p &amp; it&#39;s a &quot;must&quot; to stay there for holiday:p We spent 7 nights there. I was quite sad as I had to leave Hyatt Yogya:( coz we can do so much outdoor activities beside swimming, they have jogging track, golf, tennis, football, gym, cooking course on golf field, fishing for kids &amp; many others.  We love the big well maintain nice pool, the green lush beautiful garden, the serenity from its place, the beautiful view with small temples, the very attentive friendly helpful professional staffs who works there from the swimming pool area, restaurant, the house keeping, even the regency lounge. We feel really at home.   Most of the staffs remember our first names &amp;</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stay in this resort for one week with my family, in this resort, I love this place, love swimming pool and water slide, love the taste for breakfast, the staff are very kind and so hospitalize. stay one week but they forget our room and always aks when we breakfast in every morning."
"It was a fantastic weekend in Hyatt Jogja, very gracious Javanese ambiance. Great design of building likes borobudur temple, surrounded by 9holes golf course for fun. High tea time in &#39;pendopo&#39; is magnificent when gamelan (Javanese music) played live!"
"We came to the Hyatt from MesaStila which was always going to be tough to live up to, but what a huge disappointment this hotel was. We&#39;ve stayed at plenty of Hyatt&#39;s (the most recent in Santiago) and expected so much more. The grounds were actually lovely, as was the welcome (garlands) and reception areas, but the rooms are absolutely dreadful. Small, tired, drab - in all honesty I couldn&#39;t spend any longer than 30 minutes in my room without getting depressed. The restaurant was buffet style, the breakfast very ordinary and a la carte for dinner very poor. The upside was the staff who were lovely and accommodating. I&#39;ll think twice before booking a Hyatt again, and I urge the hotel to think about bringing the rooms up to the standards that global travellers expect."
"This is my second stay here. This place is GORGEOUS! I have stayed in first class hotels from northern New England to California and in many countries of the Middle East and in Asia and S.E. Asia. This tops them all.It is at the edge of the city. However, the minute you go through their entrance, the city disappears and you are in an amazingly exotic place without flying to Bali or Lombok. The second you step out of your transportation, you are greeted by lovely young ladies putting a lei of jasmine flowers around your neck and handsome young gentlemen helping you out and taking your luggage. Then a gong is sounded and you are accompamied with gamelan music towards the building entrance that passes water gardens and a view of some of the grounds that are breathingly Indonesian;</span><span>&hellip;"
"I had a fantastic experience as hyatt passport guest for 3 days in this beautiful hotel. A very resortish hotel about 5-7 kms away from the central town ..malioboro area ...  For starters, their staff are excellent... Right from the bell desk, security to their reception. The staff at the main restaurant are truly friendly and pleasant with impeccable service standards. The food atthe restaurant is worth a mention While the gym is really miniscule, the outdoors experience around the golf course, jogging track, their pools are very well designed.  The hotel is dated , but clean and well appointEd. The sauna, hot pool and cold plunge area could do with better maintenance and house keeping..  To sum it, ideal for a visit to borobodur, prambanan and mount merapi.. And a perfect</span><span>&hellip;"
"This was the first time to stay in this hotel.   It is 5 star hotel but now rundown , especially if we compared with other 5 star hotel in Yogyakarta.   The wing building next to my room was emptied. We could see the furniture were uncovered and that wing was dark at night.   Bedroom was not big, but it was still okay. The bathroom door was dusty, as if nobody cleaned it.  The glass door to the shower was also not clear.  Bathroom Amenities was great : tooth brush, soap, shower gel, shampoo, shaving kit, iron+iron board, pijamas, sandal  Hotel is not located in the central , hence if you plan to go to malioboro area, you need to consider the timing.   The garden was huge and nice, there was pathway for jogging or just walking . However, some part of the garden next to the lobby</span><span>&hellip;"
"The grounds of this hotel are absolutely stunning.  Beautiful flowers, pools and a gorgeous manicured golf course are really a sight to behold.  Lounging by the pool was lovely in big comfy lounge chairs, although very loud due to the many families staying there.  It&#39;s hard to get any quiet time because of the kids screaming and going down the water slide.  The pool was also extremely cold, so we did not spend much time in it.  The room itself was nice and big, but, as many other reviewers have pointed out, very out-dated and in need of some revamping.  Everything was very clean, although we found the room to be insufferably humid despite the temperature being mild outside, and our luggage was actually overweight when we left from all of our clothes being damp.  We really would</span><span>&hellip;"
"I have been a guest at this hotel for 700+ nights so obviously I have written a lot about the great service, ambiance, gardens and Golf course.  But, today I want to write about food.    Every Saturday, the hotel puts out a traditional buffet as &quot;Night Market&quot; around a Ramayana Ballet.  It consists of several good carts that serve traditional dishes from Central Java.   I have always enjoyed that good but lately the taste and quality has been raised to a much higher level.  When at market I am sure you will  Nasi goreng, staple if Indonesia or Gado Gado salad. However, I want it highly recommend &quot;Mie Godug&quot; which stands for &quot;Noodles Boiled&quot;.  Heavenly dish consisting shrimp, chicken, vegetables, some spice and touch of lime juice (Pak Vikas recipe).  The cart chef, little Chatur</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed at the Hyatt regency Yogyakarta, Indonesia in late June, 2014, for one night. Was pleasantly surprised at the lovely design and layout of this beautiful hotel - very relaxing and peaceful in the midst of a very busy, vibrant city. Breakfast setting was very pleasant, with guests having the choice of sitting inside the coffee shop or outside in the cool, morning air not far from the gorgeous pool. Delightful!  Upon arrival at the hotel, guests are greeted with a fragrant, floral lei which is a lovely touch (like in Hawaii!). Check in, however, was very slow as only one staff member seemed to be on duty at peak hour in the late afternoon, after a plane from Jakarta had arrived. Need to manage such periods better.  Room was nice but nothing particularly special. Clean, large</span><span>&hellip;"
I stayed here for 3 nights with my mom last month.. because I love the restaurant beside this hotel (Sasanti) and wow what an amazing view from the lobby.. Mount of Kelud and the golf course are a perfect combi.. but too bad the room is old and shabby.. not to mention the poor selection of the breakfast.. my friend came to join breakfast with us at 9.30 am and the food was almost finished already... he can only eat waffle... I&#39;m ashamed...   General Manager is my senior is STP Bali Hotel College.. so please Mr Nur do something with the hotel since it carries the great Hyatt name...
Pleasantly surprised by the Hyatt in Yogy. The staff are incredibly friendly. Service was great and the views were breathtaking. A excellent base for exploring Yogy and central Java and central to the markets and shopping.
"Stayed there for 1 night (on our way to visiting Borobudur temples). Very nice hotel, amazing common areas (pool, lounge, gardens), very nice spa centre and amazing breakfast. Some renovations can be made in hotel rooms. "
This Hotel were with stayed with two families and small kids was perfect! The garden and poolside are great and so are all the facilities for the kids. the rooms are spacious and the staff is very very freindly and helpfull. We will definately come back here
"We stayed here for 3 nights, a perfect place to relax after visiting the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. It&#39;s a beautiful hotel, with a fantastic garden and a 9 hole golf court. The ambiance is chic and elegant, with great atmosphere. The staff is helpful and very kind, always smiling and available. The breakfast buffet has a great choice and a very good quality. The room, we had a King deluxe, was not so big and new, but comfortable and nice with a wonderful terrace over the property and the city.  Now the problems: the biggest is the wake up at 4a.m., every day, every period of the year (not only in Ramadan) of the muezzin&#39;s prayer, coming from the close mosque. It&#39;s terribly loud and continues for half an hour. So, we couldn&#39;t sleep at all. That&#39;s a big, big problem!! And</span><span>&hellip;"
"I came with my family , wife two kids and nanny. Fun activity around the hotel including fishing among others. We were able to catch the Ramayana play as well over the weekend at the hotel so we didn&#39;t need to go out to see it which is convinient to us considering a full day activity since morning really exhaust us. One thing that bother me though there is no lock on the bathroom. And the room need to be renovate because it is a bit dated. The food also need improvement, i am amazed that the cook cannot cook me a scramble egg but omelette only instead which a bit silly to me."
"We were debating between Phoenix Hotel and Hyatt and we are so glad we chose Hyatt.  We stayed for 3 nights and it was great value for the money.  I agree the rooms need a bit of upgrading but overall the rooms were comfortable and spacious.  The entire property is very nice - great swimming pool, great golf course.  The only complaint we had was with the restaurant - they don&#39;t really seem to have a good process in place in terms of taking order and bringing food. Also, there were some items on their menu that were NEVER available for any meal during the 3 days we were there.  They should just take it off the menu then.  One thing we liked was that they did have a vegetarian menu which was great for us vegetarians.  Really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt and it was not very</span><span>&hellip;"
"Location is good, hotel is Nice, however rooms are in need of upgrade. Golfcourt is amazing.   The staff is friendly but they make to many mistakes. Need for english language course and be little more profesionnal.   One thing that was horrofying is the smell in the hotel lobby. We think it came from the smoking of the chicken, just horrible and it was for the three days that we were there.   Price/quality is very good though. Breakfast was a plus!! But with ths location, make it a 5 star hotel and charge more!"
"The hotel is beautifull situated just a bit outside the city. taxis are cheap .But the hotel has a shuttle service that we used one time ( not always there when we wanted)  Rooms are nice we were on the the club floor waht meaned we could use the tea, coffee and wine facilities Quality was excellent staff was very polite soemtimes even too polite. THe spa and massage was good and fair priced, the food was not the standard we like the duck breast was oovercooked but the breakfast was excellent when we compare this hotel with padma in bandung then we would day the hyatt winns because of the  clubfacilities the padma had a better view and a little bit better breakfast but bohe hotels offer great value for many and nice staff The hyatt had a large bath room"
"Yogyakarta is an amazing city in an amazing country. Totally worth visiting. Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is the perfect place to stay while there. Excellent is all I can say about the staff there and their services.  If you are interested in visiting the surroundings  (and I suggest you do), they can organize it perfectly for you.  We had an amazing guide with us for one day, a private car with driver and included in the package were the lunch and dinner plus all the entry fees for the temples. I recommend this guide we had, Pundji. He is an old man, but his knowledge about culture and religion is overflowing. He speaks  English fluently and his way of interacting with the tourist is totally above professional and in the same time it captivates your mind and imagination and makes</span><span>&hellip;"
"From the moment you drive through the front gate you know you&#39;re in for a luxury experience. Lush gardens and water features everywhere! Being greeted with jasmine necklaces put me right in the mood to relax. After a very quick check in we checked out our room, which was cool and most adequate. All the amenities are provided, but I liked the clarifying shampoo best, as my grey hair was starting to go green from too much swimming! Even though I went for another swim in the most fantastic pool. It had water slides, water falls and so many private places to swim and cool down.  The golf course nearby offers a great outlook - with rolling green hills and beautiful gardens. We checked out the health club and experienced the free hot spa and cold pool plunge, phew it was cold!  One</span><span>&hellip;"
"We loved this hotel. It was truly a retreat from the busy active city of Yogia. Felt completely pampered and loved their lounge as which we were able to access with Hyatt Diamond status (also available to Gold). Even without this, however the hotel is beautfully landscaped and peaceful and the staff goes above and beyond to make visitors feel completely taken care of. They were able to book us a trip to Boroburdur with 3:45 am departure time when we decided we wanted to go at 9 p.m the night before. They also have an amazing restaurant and breakfast buffet with foods and stations representing Indonesian cuisine as well as western and others. Some of the best food I sampled in Yogiakarta."
12 unforgetable days. Very friendly and warm staff. Excellent food. High levels SPA treatment. Room are very clean . Gardens are exotic style.Free transportation from the hotel to the center of the city.You feel like home.
"I had a great stay here. When I first arrived I was greeted with a necklace made from jasmine flowers. The grounds are beautiful and there is a nice view of the volcano. There are several swimming pools, including a water slide, and there is a golf course. The hotel has very nice amenities, including a free shuttle to the local shopping area, a free ride on the andok, you can also book a bicycle tour and they have a travel agency in site where you can book excursions or even just hire a driver. They also offer activities at an extra charge like a performance of the Ramayan ballet by the pool on Saturday nights. The room was a bit small but it was nice. The gym is ok, a couple of treadmills, and elliptical, a few weight machines and free weights. The food in the restaurant is</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel is located about 8 km from the centre of Yogjakarta and is a relaxing oasis in a hectic city.  The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to the centre several times a day and it is easy to rent a car and driver from the hotel.  The hotel grounds are well maintained and there are three pools, one with a fantastic water slide - ideal for children.  What really makes this hotel is the staff - very friendly, courteous, helpful, warm and welcoming!  Meals at the hotel are good value which is great if you don&#39;t want to go out in the evening after a day of sightseeing."
"As for the property itself, only kudos.  You do get the impression that it is beginning to tire just a little bit, but the care it is receiving is fantastic.  The ground are sumptuous with flowers and shrubs that accent the pools, water/stone features, and sitting areas.  All the time  we spent outside, there were several groundskeepers meticulously maintaining the property.  The breakfast was as good and vast as we&#39;ve ever encountered.  Several &quot;live&quot; stations as well as all genres of buffet offerings (both local and western).    We had an executive room, and it was well-appointed and very comfortable.  But the best thing (among all good things) was the staff.  We have stayed in innumerable high-end hotels all over the world and I have to say that the staff of this property was</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel was perfect, they have 3 large swimming pool with great drinks from the bar. The golf field just perfect. Really my kinda place for a west end style holiday! A friend in my group tried the spa in the hotel complex, staffs are very warm and nice, javanesse style. Just next to the resort you can visit unique resto. Jogja is certainly offers cultural trip."
"This weekend we explore Yogyakarta and choose Hyatt to lodge in. Its a good place to lodge in and explore the city.  This hotel offers some good facilities and activities: We had club lounge excess which was a good place to sit and enjoy the view of open golf course. They have good pool facility and breakfast at Kemangi Bistro was nice. They have awesome fish pond on a walk way to the lobby and with a good seating facility, which was amazing place to relax.They even have horse cart ride (for free) to take you around the outside periphery of the hotel. It gives a nice feel to explore the local life in close vicinity of the hotel.   They also offer some great city tour options with very helpful assistance. We got 12 hour day sight seeing which included sunrise at Borabodur temple,</span><span>&hellip;"
"Fantastic place to stay with the entire family, even if you don&#39;t have any plan to go out from the hotel. The shuttle to Malioboro is a convenience for our family when we didn&#39;t rent a car on that day. The staff are friendly and helpfull. The pools are big and fun for children. The breakfast is okay. The ambiance is AMAZING. My husband and I are looking for a relaxed easy vaction, and this place is perfect. My sons can&#39;t wait to come back."
Our first impression of the Hyatt in Jogja was not all that favorable--it seemed slightly tired.  But in the end we really enjoyed our three-day stay.  The room was comfortable and the services good.  The food in the restaurant was excellent and very reasonably priced.  But the true highlight was the staff.  Part of this seemed to be the intrinsic nature of the Javanese--very friendly and welcoming.  The staff was genuinely friendly and always pleasant.  They took the time to engage in conversation and tell us about their family and life in Indonesia.  We really enjoyed our interactions with the restaurant wait staff and the other staff in the hotel.
"We had a disaster stay at another hotel in Jogya a few years ago - so our expectations were not so high, but we were really impressed with the Hyatt. We booked a Club Room, and as usual a personal check-in in the lounge was well handled. Rooms were quite good, with everything working well and very clean.   The grounds of the hotel are very nicely kept and the pool area is large, allowing some room for a quite snooze or swim. The pool bar staff were a little slow, but you can&#39;t have everything.  The club lounge was a nice place to be, but sometimes, the staff could remind others that it should be a quiet place (i.e.  Kids being really noisy). I would recommend to go to the main restaurant for breakfast, as the selection is not so good in the lounge, but the evening cocktails are</span><span>&hellip;"
"If you plan to spend a few days in Jogja, don‚Äôt look further, this is the perfect place to stay.  Just note the hotel is not right in the centre of the town, but only 20 min by car, and also 20 min from the airport. The hotel is made in lava stones, with typically Indonesian architecture, in the middle of a very big garden and also a 9-holes golf course. All around the garden you can find stupas and statues, like in the Borobudur temple. The ambiance is guaranteed.  The swimming pool is also nicely designed, not square but several pools linked together like a promenade with bridges, a waterfall, toboggans. It‚Äôs perfect for kids. There‚Äôs also a SPA and a gym, but I didn‚Äôt try. My room was nice, very clean and comfortable. Maybe the only inconvenient was the noise from the</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed here with 2 kids, my sister family &amp; my parents. We stayed in 3 rooms.  The ambiance was cozy, staff was nice, reception relly helpful with all the information, we need. My kids and nephews loved it so mucn, they love the swimming pool that come with sliding pool. Have a fishing pond for kids with real fish.  My daughter favorite riding an Andong or delman (horse train) for free. Only 1 small thing, I&#39;ve disappointed, but I think this is human error, not the hotel fault, When I came on first day, we only have 1 tea bag, my family love having afternoon tea, but it only serve 1 tea bag each room, so we need to ask for more tea bags.   On second day, we did not get renew tea bag or additonal tea bag, they took our towel for carpet but did not replace it. And also no new</span><span>&hellip;"
"Despite all explanation, the guest service has provided completely different result. Manager in duty may not have good English skill and could not propose solution at that moment. If no problem occurs, the hotel provides acceptable service. If you experience any problem, be ready to pay whatever they charge."
"How could you dont like this hotel? First time to stay here, &quot;Oh my God, very beautiful building, greeny-pretty-garden, restaurant concept, pool park area, and all area are beautiful! I could stay here all day long just to sit in the garden towards to pool. Very beautiful view under the trees, and Hyatt also served the best foods ever. Very love it!"
"The five star hotel was located in the northern part of Yogyakarta, quite far from the main attraction the city could offer, but if you wanted restful sleep, some peace and quiet, it would serve your need. I meant, this was the kind of hotel that people consciously chose when they actually wanted to spend some time in it to relax and enjoying the atmosphere. The hotel screamed lush and lavish, for me. From the elaborate design of its architecture (it was inspired by the Borobudur temple, it seemed), complicated swimming pool, golf course, green and beautiful garden as far as eyes could see and tables meant for perfect candle light dinner in open space, chocolate on the pillow (or flower? I forgot) with well-wishing message, it was clear that the hotel was designed to bring</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed there a few days back. It is a good location to access Borobudur and prambanan temples from. It is a sprawling property with fountains and landscapes gardens. Service is good but vegetarian fare was rather unimaginative. The chefs there did not know what a Thai curry was. Lunch and dinner was a bit of a challenge but we managed.   They had a Ramayana show over dinner one evening. It was enjoyable, though again, our veg food was quite bad.  There was a free half hour horse cart ride around the hotel into the nearby village. We did that one morning. It was from the hotel reception and takes you into the side roads. Was interesting but not a must do.  The cafe on the golf course has live music on thurs and fri, with a dj performing on Saturday. We went there for a drink</span><span>&hellip;"
"Huge green area with golf course, although rooms are quite old but still nice, comfort and luxurious. staffs are excellent, quick response and very friendly, especially if you&#39;re a hyatt member. Swimming pools are superb, the best in yogyakarta i guess. Spa is excellent too.  Food menu varieties could be better"
Love the atmosphere! The pool is fantastic!  One thing bad will be very difficult to catch taxi. So prepare to use the hotel car service at a higher rate. Overall it was a pleasant stay with my partner!
"Where on trip With Pata, the Norway branch in may 2014 to wisit this hotel. Its Nice, they have their own golf range, 9 holes. Big swimming pool, Nice to swim in. The hotell i Nice, but you can see in the hotel rooms that it should be upgraded in the future, it seems √• little old. But very good servise and Nice resturants, so please use the hotel if you og there."
"hyatt regency yogya is very suitable for family and addict golfer like me. Kids csn enjoy the resort swimming pool, whilst I play a round or two of golf . Great view of Merapi volcanic mountain, nice although small room."
This is a second visit to Hyatt Regency YOG.  The checkin service was fast and prompt.  This time round booked a visit to the Borobudur.  We have to depart early in the Morning as the Journey is about 2hours.  The going was alright but returning was slow due to traffic jam.  Borobudur is worth the visit if you are in YOG.
"I stayed here for 2 nights. I like very much the jogging track. The rest are very nice, comfort and enjoyable. The service is fast, very high qualifed staffs. Breakfast is very good, good mix of local  and western breakfast."
"I stayed in Hyatt Yogya during the eruption of Mt. Semeru Last February, and since the airport was closed, I was forced to extend my stay for another 2 nights...  Since I couldn&#39;t go out and enjoy Yogya, so I decided to stay at the hotel and enjoy the euphoria of the eruption. I should say, I enjoyed the unique colonial impression of the room as well as the corridors. The restaurant never lacked of food even due to the eruption, and the food was always nicely presented.  One thing I thank the most is that the service was not affected by the eruption..., the waitresses and waiters performs high standard service, the front officers always update safety information and making sure that everything is under control, and even the housekeeping keeps on sweeping the never ending dust...</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed in Hyatt Yogyakarta for 2 nights, would have stayed longer if there was availability. Fist of all the ground are impressive, the staff is very service oriented and would go an extra mile to deliver an excellent service. My son fell on the stairs and banged his lip, the manager on duty offered to take us to the hospital at the hotel&#39;s expense. This was very kind of him. The reception staff took notice of the names of my kids and always addressed me by the name, a nice personal touch. The breakfast was fresh and sufficient, however didn&#39;t offer a lot of variety.  The Joglo massage was very relaxing. The activities that hotel offers are very well thought. I would only mention a few negatives that prevent me from giving the hotel 5 points. - the mattresses in the rooms are</span><span>&hellip;"
My husband and I stayed at the hotel for our short honeymoon to Yogyakarta. It&#39;s a great place to stay at in Jogja. The food is amazing and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The golf-course looks great and the place is peaceful and serene. We really had a wonderful time there!
"Me and my wife planned to stay for 3 nights from 8th April, 2014 and we cut short our stay to 2 days as we changed our earlier program to go to Sourabhaya to visit Bromo. This hotel impresses as soon as you enter with a huge garden and a view of Merapi volcano. The swimming pool area and the adjacent golf course with full greeneries really make you feel happy and comfortable. We chose a club room whcih was quite big, spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was very huge and complete with Asian, Continental cuisnes with fruits, eggs etc., We visited their lounge which provided enough finger food and drinks. But, they provided only Jim Beam Whisky in the whisky section. It takes considerable amount of time going around the swimming pool, gardens and the golf course area.   My wife</span><span>&hellip;"
"As you enter the lobby , breathtaking views of the Mount Merapi. The hotel is tastefully done with lots of Jog Jakarta architecture, green lawns, awesome pool and pond and a convenient golf course.  Its an ideal place to relax with family. The restaurants are good and the service is excellent."
"Excellent facilities, pool, golf course.  Lots to do in Yogjakarta. A bit out of the main tourist area, but then this is a resort with lots to do on site. Good beds, staff pleasant and well trained. Room service was exceptionally slow, but I think this was not the norm and they did apologise. Great restaurant at the gallery next door if you tire of the various (many) options on site. BUT beware of functions, weddings, conferences, they may just ruin your holiday. Will visit again but wary of functions."
"The pool is very nice, room is spacious, great location and environment, nice staff..  I stayed in this hotel with my wife and very pleased with this Hotel. Obviously, Hyatt Regency is my most favourite Hotel in Yogyakarta."
"Family with kids visiting temples around Yogyakarta, the hotel is perfect. In midst lush gardens, quiet, with a 9-hole golf course and the highlight, the pool landscape!! Beautiful pool runs like a small river under trees giving shadow, bridges, waterfall and....a temple/pyramid/water slide that goes really fast! Fantastic for the kids to cool down and use up the extra energy accumulated in hours of traffic jams while driving to temples;-). There are some games, activities (horse cart riding, jogging track, etc.) The rooms of the hotel are ok, the food also (not spectacular, some dishes really good, some so so). For the business traveller or the ones needing WiFi: the WiFi is poor: unstable signal does not reach well even in common areas, need to re-login every five minutes.</span><span>&hellip;"
"Hyatt is a great place to stay,a great place to reduce my level of stress from work. The staffs are very kind as they tries to comfort me whenever possible like offering me a drink and activities. There are alot of activities at the hotel like golf, swimming, spa or just food leisure."
"Nga nyesel book Regency Club Twin di hotel ini, welcome greeting, room, service, breakfast, semua nya TOP punya, Kami sempat mengundang tamu untuk breakfast, harganya jg nga mahal, sempat kaget juga, krn terbiasa harga di Jkt yg muahal. Uda gitu karena kami book di regency club nya, kami bebas ke area Regency Club Lounge... bebas nge-tea and nge-wine sesuka hati.. Pokoke kami puas banget, next time will choose this hotel when come back to Yogya.... c u"
"The design of the hotel was patterned on the Borobudor temple and I think it looks amazing. The hotel gives the you a very relaxing and calm ambiance that will certainly make you feel relaxed. They have a big pool with a slide, a massive area for golf and an area where you can just roam around. I went here for work and I never even felt tired because of the hotel ambiance and of course its service. I&#39;m always very particular with the service of a hotel since that makes really an impact on your stay on whether they gave you a warm welcome and stay. I think this hotel aced the service part. The hotel is really clean and their rooms are in good shape, however it would be better if they will renovate their rooms so it will look a bit modern to keep up with the modern look of other</span><span>&hellip;"
"Many people debate whether to stay in Yogyakarta at the Phoenix or whether to stay at one of the resorts outside the city.  While the Phoenix is a great hotel, it&#39;s better to stay at one of the lush resorts on the outskirts of town and the Hyatt is tough to beat.  It sits on a huge property, is surrounded by a very good golf course, and has an incredible pool facility.  It&#39;s location is convenient for half-day trips to each of Borobadour, Prambanan and Yogyakarta.  Be sure to catch the &quot;country village&quot; dinner buffet."
"A 2 night Gold Points Regency Club redemption stay.  Stop 4 of 8 accomodation, 18 night independent trip through SE Asia.  Emails for airport pickup never confirmed.  Standard charge for taxi at airport was about $6US to hotel.  A little confusing: it turns out the dispatcher has the number on your voucher so be attentive and don‚Äôt worry if it seems people are getting ahead of you on the taxi line.  Impressed immediately upon arrival.  Greated very attentively from the moment we pulled up.  This really is a beautifully designed, landscaped and maintained property‚Ä¶.just MAGICAL !  Escorted to Regency Club.  Nice sit down check in with a welcome drink and cold towel but the charming eager staff member left my passport in the photocopier and never asked me about newspaper</span><span>&hellip;"
"The grounds are gorgeous -- serene, quiet, calm and very Bali. The guest rooms are a little dated, however the level of service erases that minor detail in spades. I stayed at the top 3 hotels in Yogya and Hyatt is by far the best for SERVICE and location. It&#39;s slightly outside the epic traffic in town and so peaceful -- just amazing.... Treat yourself at the Hyatt Yogya!"
"enjoy your day with your family here... it&#39;s a good place to relax from busy things..  the room is not that big, maybe for hyatt it&#39;s quite small, but the environment is awesome..enjoy the pool so much and they provide variants of food for breakfast with pool view.  It&#39;s not close with Malioboro (shopping district), you will need a taxi to go there.  But overall, I like this hotel and recommend you to stay here!"
"I visited Yogyakarta to spend a one day short vacation, after selecting a few hotels in Yogyakarta, I finally chose the hyatt regency,the image of the front lobby overlooking the golf course is the main thing that attracted me and my spouse, and we certainly plan to relax in front of the lobby in the evening and in the morning of the next day, unfortunately when we arrived at the hotel on 12th of February yesterday, the front lobby was filled with billboards of one cleaning service company, that makes the beauty of the front lobby is lost, and not only that, the access is also exclusively provided for that cleaning service company.  Naturally a hotel is looking for a profit, but it should be remembered that other guest of the hotel  IS ALSO guest at the hotel who has the right</span><span>&hellip;"
The hotel rooms are getting a little old now and are due for a renovation soon however the lobby and garden area is amazing. Very nice. I went for a jog on the jogging track and was very impressed. Buffet breakfast was good too with lots of imported food on offer.
"This is a good although not outstanding hotel, but there were no major faults to report. A real highlight was the outdoor swimming pool(s), which snake around the gardens with elegant bridges and water slides. The service was excellent and the prices seemed reasonable. The room was spacious although a little bit dated. Overall it was a good experience. "
"The hotel is not situated in central of yogya, which is nice so it has a mountainy feeling when you are there, but it is not so far from the city centre. Love the landscaping, it has golf course and nice ponds and greenery. The building architecture was modelled after borobudur itself which is quite unique. Rooms are a bit old, can do a renovation especially the flooring. Lobby and common area are well maintained. Nice selection of breakfast. Love their foods. Would stay here again next time."
"The Hyatt has great grounds (and a golf course) that seem out of place in the suburban sprawl-chaos of Yogyakarta.  There is a great pool, adequate spa, adequate restaurant (the best dish we tried was the candle-nut containing luxury nasi goreng), adequate (for Indonesia) wifi and cabled internet access, and a shop selling superlative batik on-site. Room was clean, spacious and functional. We used the travel agency next to the lobby (you can reserve ahead of arrival through the Hyatt concierge) for day-trips to Prambanan and Borobudur.  We visited the latter at sun-rise.  Despite the relatively high cost of the Borobudur sun-rise, it was well worth it, considering the mass of tourists that arrive at the normal opening hour.  They run a free shuttle bus into the urban core of</span><span>&hellip;"
"This really is one of the best looking and designed hotels out there. Amazing gardens, good rooms, excellent bathrooms and a very good restaurant. Staff are great, especially in the restaurant. Great breakfasts. Shortcomings: bed linen is poor. kids club and gym are token gestures. Club lounge is poorly run in regard to food and beverages and hardly worth the extra charge for a Club Room."
"I stayed here for two nights ,when I went to Borobudur temple . It is little out of town , but there is nothing in the town . The landscape in the 60 acres resort is stunning , there is a golf course also . But the rooms left much to be desired ,they were average .Maintenance was poor , Staff were very courteous , but not very well informed. Spa is pathetic and the Gym was ordinary. Food was okay . Only saving grace was the reasonable price and the lovely gardens. It was a pleasure to walk around . The quality of a Hyatt was missing . But this  is one of the best and reasonable options in Yogyakarta"
"I was there with my family this summer. I love the atmosphere of the hotel. It&#39;s really big and taking a walk there is definitely something to do. The spa is really reasonably priced, and I recommend you going there. Also, there is a slide at the pool!"
"It&#39;s amazing to get off the dusty streets crowded with mopeds and step into a lush resort. The pool was awesome and the drinks at Bogey&#39;s, the on-site bar, were delicious. Cool architecture and near Boroburdur, which is was very cool."
"Booked this place last minute after canceling previously booked Phoenix (best travel decision I ever made). Don&#39;t be afraid of out of town location - there is no need to stay in town (it&#39;s very hectic and polluted). This place is big, green, clean and beautiful with excellent customer service. Place where one can relax and recharge butteries after day of sightseeing. Highly recommended."
"A bit away (15 min by car) from city center, lay this garden theme (including golf course) hotel. So green and Jawa theme. Pool is nice, kids can enjoy whole day at pool. Plus kids activities like ride horse cart, etc. Room is a bit small for Hyatt standard but bed is good. Details like welcoming jasmine flowers chain over your neck when arrived first time, welcome drinks, are nice one. Buffet breakfast selection is good enough. Combination of international and local delicacies. However dinner buffet can be better. The steak they provided was chewy like rubber. The spa is nice one. The massage quality is so good and price is reasonable. If you want to relax, this hotel is the place. But if you want to be in the middle of the city life, this one is away."
"What attracted me for the first time was the nice landscape this hotel has. However, i found that hotel room is too small for a hyatt hotel standard but amenities were very complete. The hotel itself reminds me of Borobudur, the biggest Buddhist temple in Java, bottomline, it is very an artistic building. We really enjoy the breakfast here, nice food with various choices, i love the the pancake, but chef really has to learn more on baking waffles, it was too crunchy and dry. The other thing i love is the swimming pool. Huge and beautiful swimming pool with a slider, we love it. I think this hotel is not expensive for a hyatt class hotel, worth to stay in."
"The property is very beautiful and the hotel is more like a resort - golf course, very nice swimming pool etc. The service however was very disappointing. The staff was very friendly but generally very slow in responding to requests. In the restaurants you could always see lots of staff but every time you wanted something, it was always very hard to grab anyone&#39;s attention.  We ate only at the coffee shop and the quality of western dishes like Pizza and Pasta was average at best.  The place is quite kid friendly though. "
"Stay at this hotel for 3 night at the regency club, Kings room, amazing view straight to Merapi mountain, huge room, comfy bed..  It was my husband birthday and the hotel staff was amazing, they helpe me prepare a surprise cake in room, and great buffet dinner for new years party. They even decorating our room with flowers.. Our stay was wonderfull and the resort was amazing.. Thank you hyatt ! we definatelly coming back !"
"I have been a frequent guest of this hotel over last 10 years.   I am amazed of the changing menu and different recipes that have been tried and served over the years.  But this year in particular, the resident chef Catur is outdoing himself by introducing a lot of Asian flair from Indian and Arabian cuisine.    In addition, for the New Year Celebration, The Mexican Chicken Fajitas and Vegetarian Nachos were outstanding.  Keep up the good work Catur and I&#39;ll keep coming.  Must try to like it."
"We spent five days at the Hyatt in Yogya.  Our stay was ok. We were greeted upon arrival and checked into our room without the check in process standing out in any particular way.  Our room was quite spacious and again, just ok. Our issue with the room was that it was very dusty. My husband is sensitive to dust and started sneezing shortly after we entered the room. The big, thick curtains in particular look like they could use a clean or perhaps be exchanged for a new pair.  The staff were very kind and attentive and made us feel very welcome. At the restaurant they even addressed us by names a few times which was impressive.  We had several meals in the restaurant and enjoyed the food which was tasty and price worthy.  During our stay, we used the pool only once. Although I</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed there with my family. Consist of me , my little bro , my father , abd my mum. At first I fell in love with the design of the hotel , I thought our stay would be great. But , disaster began when we were checking in . SOME of the recepcionist staff weren&#39;t firndly to the local guests (include us). We were not given welcome drinks and welcome towel, while the foreigners guest were given that things. The coordination between the housekeepers and the recepcionist also not very good. We requested an extra bed when we checked in , but they said tgat they ran iut of extrabed . So , on the 2nd day we checked again our extra bed request . They said that they still dont uave any extra ved but they have some matress , so we requeat the matress ro be delivered to our room. At that</span><span>&hellip;"
"The grounds of this hotel set it apart from the rest in Yogyakarta. In the middle of a typical noisy Indonesian city, the Hyatt is spread out along a lush golf course so it&#39;s a very pleasant place to relax and unwind. The pools are huge and come complete with waterfall and a Borobudur-style waterslide. There&#39;s a separate building with the spa/sauna and an outdoor bar/restaurant overlooking the putting green which seems to have live music and DJs on various nights.   It is a bit far out of the city centre - 10-15mins by taxi depending on traffic. Although for me there wasn&#39;t much to see in the town after the shopping street and the palace, so if you&#39;re in JOG for relaxation or to see temples, the location is no problem.  The hotel is quite large, and the rooms are typical</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed in this hotel more than 3x and its always on a business trip (still with leisure). Location is quite far from Adi Sucipto airport and from the city. This hotel located in Jalan Palagan Tentara Pelajar and I think the reason behind this is for the comfort and land size that they provide for the golf course surrounding the hotel area.  Breakfast was Hyatt standard with broad food variety, from: local traditional food such as gudeg, fresh salad, fresh fruits, yoghurt, cereals, fresh milk, and also asian range. For ala carte I&#39;ve tried their lamb shanks and I believe this is not the best but its still good.   Receptionist were good. Once, they&#39;ve helped me, when hotel was fully booked and I needed to stay for 1 additional night they helped me search for available room. They</span><span>&hellip;"
"Decided to spend some family time together in JOG.  This hotel is tuck in a huge lovely garden and big pool.  The pool has a small slide and a large one for all family members.  The food was great but to salty, so I recommend you get tell the staff to reduce the salt.  They have a complimentary horse cart ride around the near by villages.  Join the Ramayana nights where they serve great Javanese food and entertainment.  Will come back again in Jan 2014."
"Hyatt Regency Hotel is one of the very few 5 star hotel in Yogyakarta. The entry was breath taking, the public area are well appointed. We reserved two rooms with two single beds each for the four of us. The room rate included tax and tip and breakfast for two and WiFi was beyond being reasonable at around $100 per night.  The breakfast was good and had a good variety to choose from. the services were very good everywhere we went.  the rooms were very nice, comfortable and clean.  The bath rooms are showing their age and con be a candidate for upgrading. At this price, we had no complains."
"Actually the hotel are one of the best hotel in town, you can feel the full resort experience in this hotel. Very comfortable to escape from the hustle bustle of life in the big city. The weather surrounding are perfectly fresh, the hotel are surrounded by a small jungle and golf course which makes it so green and comfortable.  The hotel room are spacious since I take the Club Room, everything was great inside. Find it by yourself, the you&#39;ll said the same with me.   The swimming pool are unique, it was a salted water swimming pool. A big area of pool, separated in some part of different level of pool.   Very nice if you are travelling for honey moon or with your family, you can enjoy the hotel without thinking to go to another place."
The best hotel in Yogyakarta HANDS DOWN! Staff members are friendly and knowledgeable! Has a rustic and unique ambience. Rooms&amp;bath are clean as you&#39;d expect for a 5 star Hyatt hotel! Breakfast was OK.
"We looked for a three days stance at a relaxing place to be with our baby and do nothing but rest. I think it perfectly matched with our needs. Staff is very friendly, professional and clean. Room is big enough and perfectly clean. Facilities are great. Massive gardens, 2km long jogging trail, golf course makes it rather isolated from pollution of roads or noises from clubs.  Maybe if you&#39;re looking for a good place to visit Jogjakarta the Hyatt is not located at the best spot, but if like us you&#39;ve already seen all many times and just want to relax and disconnect from the busy Jakarta, this is probably better option than Sheraton Mustika (not that Sheraton was bad, though). If we need to highlight something with room for improvement: no watch in the room, and swimming pool</span><span>&hellip;"
"Attended a conference held in this Hotel.    The property is in a beautiful setting, with a golf course within the property.  On arrival, found the staff friendly and efficient.  The walks around the property are fabulous as the paths wind around the golf course and gardens.  A very big plus.  Rooms are well laid out; although the VIP room I was in was not anything bad but nothing great either - certainly did not warrant an VIP title.  The infrastructure was very basic; not one would expect from Hyatt.  The food options in the three restaurants are similar !  So one can&#39;t have choice here. However the setting are quite different.  My favorite is the Bar and Restaurant furtherst from reception, near the Golf course - mainly for its location.  Buffet food in main restaurant is I</span><span>&hellip;"
"Love the Grounds, the Architecture, the Proportions of the spaces, the layouts... simply amazing. I try to avoid large Hotels, but have to say that this Hyatt is simply the most elegant i have seen. The suites are standard, nothing special but very clean, the Bathrooms are large and a bit odd, but the Balconies add a beautiful dimension to the otherwise pretty &quot;regular&quot; Hyatt interiors.   It is all about the Outdoor Spaces, stunning!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And GREAT PROFESSIONAL HOTEL STAFF!!!! Made it all very relaxing."
"Every time we&#39;re in Indonesia for holiday, we always come to visit this cultural city Yogyakarta &amp; always staying at this hotel:) I think that speaks for the hotel  itself;) and we were there during Yogyakarta Royal Wedding:)  I just loveeeeeeeeeeeee the green nice surrounding with many beautiful green garden, the mini javanese temples, the fish ponds, the view, beautiful big swimming pool, extremely polite &amp; friendly staffs:) I just love being here.  We stayed here for 7 days:) staying in Club Regency Room which we can use the club regency lounge, the staffs in this hotel made us immediately feel welcome:)   Nice bfast with big foods variation, you could have bfast outdoor in garden/in door, children camp to keep the children busy, they provide shuttle car to the city in</span><span>&hellip;"
"Since 13 years we always coming back to this hotel and after this &quot;long&quot; time we still so happy with this hotel. We have already seen all the really recommended sight seeings around, we only come to be in this hotel. Take the airport pick up service and arrive very relaxed at the hotel. The first impression will stay for ever and that really true. The hotel staff welcome you with flowers and smiling faces. You will feel home and welcome from the first second in this hotel. The check is fast and well organized. If you have booked the Regency Club rooms you will have a separately check in. The hotel rooms are friendly and well maintained. The hotel provide fresh fruits and free bottle of water for your stay. Internet connection is free of charge and working quite well. Really</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed here for one night, to visit Prambanan and Borobodur.  I wish I could have stayed longer. This is an outstanding hotel. Excellent rooms, excellent breakfast, warm welcome and service. The hotel arranged for my airport pick-up as well as my tours to both these places, including the evening ballet performance at Prambanan.  As a result, I was able to see and do all that I wanted in the limited time that I had. Highly recommended!"
"This hotel is a beauty, the grounds are stunning, the food good, the service excellent,and the room was nice as well. We stayed 4 nights and loved just walking around the grounds in the mornings, before heading off to see temples and palaces. A great stay"
"I stayed in this hotel with my colleagues.  There was more than 30 of us and not a single complaint!  The bed was comfortable,the staff were attentive, the service is outstanding, everything was well organised.  They arranged our bus and early check in of our flight, so we did not have to rush to the airport.  The spa area could be improved/upgraded.  It looks old."
"We had a corporate family gathering here for 3 days. Very cooperative in terms of rooms arrangement. A welcoming flower bouquet and drink are good thoughts. Food were great. My son loooved the pool. The room is spacious. I was happy to find a weight scale in the bathroom. Good gesture. üòÑ Location is perfect, either to go in town or out of town. I would stay here again. "
Pro The room is  designed beautifully.   The food are delicious  The staffs are very polite and helpfull The bath equiptments are complete they also have a bath tub to relax in  Con Located too far from centre of jogjakarta  
"This is our 3rd time staying at Hyatt Regency Yogya. We always like the spacious green area at the hotel, where our kid can run and play, and they have lots of activities for kids to do at the hotel. The breakfast was great, various food selection and taste nice as well. The room is a bit small, though. We stayed at the standard room, and the regency club room. And since it is surrounded by spacious green area, the air is fresher compare to other 5 star hotel in yogyakarta."
"I liked the idea of giving jasmine-garland upon arrival - so nice and attentive. With a family of 3 we stayed for 4-nights here for my Birthday holiday. We loved the buffet breakfast everyday and the stretched pool all around the main garden of the hotel. Everything was clean and looked after. We enjoyed the free ride on their horse-cart going around the hotel neighborhood. The front desk staff were all very helpful including the security guard and the doorman who offered my son feeding fish in the pond along the main gate anytime he passed-by. We had a small maintenance issue in the bathroom but the engineering staff quickly solved the problem. One note though, we had a candle light dinner reserved on our last night but we found that the waitperson was not prepared and had</span><span>&hellip;"
"From the minute we step in till the minute we step out, everything was just right. The staff were great, the room was perfect, the pool is nice, plus the activity available provided by the hotel was splendid. Keep it up Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta"
"Everything was great about this hotel starting with  the fantastic welcome with life flowers (jasmine) necklace. We booked tours to the temples (Prambanan and Borobudur) via the hotel and they were just great.  We traveled with the driver and a guide (Koko) and we can recommend both.  Food was delicious and safe which is important in this part of the world.  Room in the hotel was very clean and very big.  The view was magnificent. The swimming pools are multilevel and there is fantastic water cascade by the end of one of the pools.  Decoration reflects the surrounding temples, it is very different.  We loved our stay there. The price was quite reasonable as well  Alcohol was very expensive compared to food price."
"If you visit Indonesia, also if you plan to go to just in Bali, you must have before a stop in Yogyakarta. You can visit the most popular archeological site of Indonesia: Borobudur and Prambanan. You can stay at Hyatt Jog and you can have a perfect starting point to visit both of site. The rooms are nice, the breakfast is excellent, the common space are really beautiful and the park is simply fantastic. You can have a really pleasant stay with a very convenient rates."
After a long morning of managing the traffic filled streets of busy Yogyakarta we arrived at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta.  After presenting my Diamond a=card at the front desk we were escorted to the Regency Club Lounge for a more personal check in experience.  The staff are amazing always on the look out for you and always addressing you by name.    The ground of this hotel are some of the best I have every been exposed to.  The entrance sports koi ponds and quiet reflecting pools overlooking the very large and interesting swimming pools with a further backdrop of a perfect 18 hole golf course.  The Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is literally an oasis in the middle of this very busy city. When you are there you feel relaxed and well cared for.  I would strongly suggest that you</span><span>&hellip;
"Great Hyatt service, nice recognition of my status.  After a hot day going around Borodudur, coming back is a treat.  The pool is amazing and even has a slide.  Good breakfast and great service, would definitely come back!"
"We were having a family reunion at Yogyakarta. After driving more than twelve hours we finally manage to arrived sometimes at noon. The reception was crowded at that time but the check in process was running smoothly. We were amazed with the warm welcoming by the staffs in front and impress with the hotel facilities. Since there were two families with us the hotel activities was also very accommodative. There&#39;s no point spending most of your time struggling in Yogyakarta roads with the traffic if you have it all here. Food was also nice. Overall, very recommended."
"We are just returning from an extended trip to Indonesia and the very first place I want to review its the Hyatt in Yogya.  It is a gorgeous property with outstanding,  truly five star service.   It is not however technically with the city limits so Tripadvisor lists out in Ngaglik.  This is unfortunate.   While not in the busy tourist area, it is easy to get anywhere via cab.  Really, given the reasonable rates, I can&#39;t imagine staying anywhere else. "
"If I ever go back to Yogya, I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel.  Great staff, excellent facilities, restaurants, activities, an awesome pool with a couple of slides.  You  name it - they seem to have everything to make sure that your stay is comfortable.  My daughter had a birthday the day we arrived, they staged a little birthday party for her in evening, together with photos and a frame as a momento.  It was a great way to finish our holiday.  We stayed in 3 hotels in and around Yogya - this is by far the best."
"The grounds of the hotel are quite lovely.  From the outside:entrance, pool, patio, golf course- you think you&#39;ve entered a very nice tropical five star hotel.  The lobby is fine however the decor shows more evidence of a typical Hyatt.  By the time you get to your room, the five star hotel is gone and now, it&#39;s more like a two star.  The rooms are basic, dated, worn but worst of all dirty.  Our shower had mold on the tile and a plastic bath mat in the shower, hair on the floor and wall, the room really needed a good cleaning.  The staff are very sweet however, minus a few superstars, not very effective.  We got a good deal on the room and only stayed a few nights so not a total loss.  The bed was actually pretty comfortable.  For the rooms I&#39;d give it a poor and for the grounds</span><span>&hellip;"
"I have been stayed in Hyatt Yogyakarta with my family for few times, we always stay at the Regency suit. The Hyatt&#39;s green environment, away form city centre, also their large and nice swimming pool.  The main thing we love about this hotel is the excellence service staff and at the regency club especially, they are very nice and helpful. The only minor thing happens was when we tried to order coffee latte at the swimming pool, it took ages to be arrived, which we cancelled at the end due to we needed to leave the pool for breakfast. Overall, this hotel is beautiful, homely and value for money. We will absolutely comeback again next time."
"The Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta combines Javanese hospitality, western comfort, and Indonesian lay-back attitude.  The rooms are comfortable, the gardens are perfect, the swimming pool well-designed, including a water slide, and set in a beautiful garden.  Wish we had time to play a round of gold, but taking our grandchildren for the first visit to Indonesia, we spent more time traveling around the city sites, which are many and each one more interesting than the other. The kitchen crew took special care to provide special food to member of our family who had allergy issues with some of the food ingredients.  Great staff. Kudos to the hotel staff and management for making our stay perfect."
"The check-in process took longer than expected, the check-out confusion in billing and other arrangements just sealed the experience on a lower note.  Although most of the staff are courteous and polite, I wouldn&#39;t say the same for some.  The room needs some refurbishing works. The shower drainage is clogged. The upside to this hotel are the nicely kept gardens and grounds."
"My American husband and daughter and an Italian friend stayed here in July and August. We had planned to stay for just a few days, but the caring and attentive Javanese staff, the food, the pool and grounds, room accommodations and the value of the stay was so wonderful that we cancelled our plans to move on and stayed for nearly 2 weeks! The morning buffet breakfast with Indonesian and western foods was very special, as was the Saturday night Javanese dinner and drama. The Yogya Hyatt made a wonderful family vacation even more special!"
"Phoenix or Hyatt?  I am a Hyatt platinum member so I did choose the Hyatt.  Arriving at the beautiful gardens and well maintained lobby, corridors and grounds made me feel as if I made the right choice. But the check-in experience was terrible. I booked a club room and arrived at 3PM. Room not available. All kinds of excuses, but the room was only ready after one hour. No preferred room as promised, no view or quiet room as asked for. The room itself is ok, but in need of renovation. I missed my Hyatt bed I normally get in a Hyatt. The shower was working and it is nice when there is a bit of water power, but this one was too strong for me, it even hurt a bit. Club facilities were closed the last morning of my stay because of Ramadan. No problem, but I think they should have told</span><span>&hellip;"
"view was so wonderful. im amazed with the staff, landscape, and the swiming pool. they have very beautiful view of golf course. if you dont stay in this hotel at least you have to tray to swim in this very beatiful pool!"
"I stay es many times in Here. Everyday time satisfied and especially staff service. They provide very Good service especially in regency Club lounge. We are so amazed when we joined in the evening cocktail party Every evening time. Spesial Thanks for Yayon San , Melryna San and friends. Hope we Will see you again in our next visit."
"One of the most beautiful hotel in Yogyakarta, room with the view of golf course, beautiful garden and swimming pool, spacious room and extensive amenities. Great food on breakfast buffet. A bit far from the city but all paid is worth your stay in here."
"We 2A &amp; 2C stayed in the executive suite in regency club for 6 nights during Ramadan. Our excursions from the hotel were fantastic and well co-ordinated through the tour desk or concierge at transport desk. Breakfast was very good with a wide selection , and staff here were very good also. Food at the poolside was OK - good and resonable value. Unfortunately the staff in the regency club have a very smug attitude and makes for requests met with an uncomfortable indifference. Would suggest staff are rotated so as not to get to cosy and complacent. All other management &amp;  staff appear to project the standard of Hyatt, but not the full time regency staff. The spa area is NOT 5 STAR but closer to 3 STAR. Golf course OK, 7 par3&#39;s and 2 par4&#39;s well maintained ,a good walk. For</span><span>&hellip;"
"Our family of three stayed for four nights in July 2013. Overall we had a really nice stay. We opted for a club room which gave as free wifi, a larger room and drinks between 5 and 7 each night. It was good value for us.  Overall the place is on the older side but seemingly well kept and clean. The rooms are dated but clean and functional. The highlight for us was the gardens and outdoor areas. The pools are glorious with a large waterslide to keep the kids happy. It never seemed busy and was a great source of relaxation for us. There is a little fishing pond that our six year old delighted in and the kids club was used on one occasion. Sadly (or not from our sons view) it rained during his time at the kids club and as a result he got to play video games for the duration. He was</span><span>&hellip;"
"This place is VERY nice. Went here for business, but that didn&#39;t keep me from checking out the pools which included a multi-story slide! The food was very good. They also had a bar with a live band at night, located a ways away from the rooms as to not keep anyone awake too late. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I got a traditional massage which was pretty good.   The only thing I did not like about the hotel was that my toilet would make loud noises about every hour through the night. Needless to say, I didn&#39;t get a lot of sleep.  Something great was our day trip to one of the nearby temples. If you do this, bring water, and go early! The heat will get to you."
"Returning back to Hyatt Yogyakarta brought me back to my first time impression when I came to this hotel. And I never regret the decision. This time I came back to tried on the Ramadhan package. They offered me lower rate and with bunch of additional services I get. Service from the staff, never doubt about that.. they are the best! very attentive, genuine smile, very coordinated. The surprise was when I entered the room, I did find something new. The new amenities offered for ladies. All this time, I have to carry all my &quot;war ladies supplies&quot; but I realize now I don&#39;t have to! They gave us all the women amenities needed from hair brush, nail polish, make up removal until curly hair tools (the last items unfortunately not for free *wink). this is awesome! I wish every hotel will</span><span>&hellip;"
"Beautiful architecture, you leave the main road and think you&#39;re in the middle of the countryside. The rooms are also tastefully furnished, to Hyatt&#39;s specifications. Major minus is the bathroom: There is no hand-held shower, only a fixed showerhead above your head. This is common in the US but not practical. Also, the toilet does not have a hand-held shower head common in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. As for WiFi, guests get 30 minutes free in the room only, unless they subscribe to an expensive plan. You can get 24 hours WiFi in your room if you join Hyatt&#39;s membership club. Totally inacceptable for a 5-star hotel! The quality of the breakfast is mediocre, the cappuccino is a a brew beyond description, better to order tea here. Despite this still a pleasant stay and</span><span>&hellip;"
Great experience in check in process. The service was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful.  We were satisfied .Even though we still hear another activity side our room or little bit annoying but it doesn&#39;t matter for us.
"I stayed in Hyatt Regency for the Google Search Summit in Yogyakarta Indonesia. Check-in is a breeze and i love the gingery scent once you enter their lobby. My room was huge with a king sized bed and a wonderful view! The minibar was locked, which is a good thing as it kept me from eating something from the minibar. Every night they have musicians at the piano bar and they&#39;re great at playing both Western and Indonesian music. The breakfast buffet was also great, so many choices and everything so delicious, the restaurant is not really crowded and you can choose the best place for you to take your breakfast. One thing i have to say is that i almost am late during our sessions in the search summit because of oversleeping, the bed is so comfy and nice. The ground area is huge and</span><span>&hellip;"
"I went there for the Google Search summit 2013 and loved the stay. Their staff is really friendly and smiles all the time you see them. Some communication barriers exist but it can be handled by telling them in simple language.  I had a pickup from the airport, but I think there are several taxi options from the airport to the hotel. It has a taxi service from the hotel which charges a fixed amount to any destination, but most outside taxis are cheaper if you step outside and wait a few minutes.  Make sure you have arranged transport to the airport the day before you leave because they need one day to arrange, but they will call an external cab for you as well. But the hotel option is safer and more convenient when it comes to last moment issues. With bad traffic, airport time</span><span>&hellip;"
"At check in I struggled to get the attention of the hotel staff.. There was a big party of people checking in at the same time as us... What is supposed to happen is that you get a welcome drink while you wait. The staff distributing the drinks was busy searching out Members of the Indonesian party that was checking in but totally ignored us for some reason.. It then took half an hour for us to get some attention and eventually we got checked in. I complained to the manager and he was not particularly helpful... Fair play, they had set up our rooms as requested, an extra bed in each room and the rooms with a connecting door. The rooms were very cramped and old feeling. The view from the hotel room is amazing and the grounds of the hotel really are something to be seen! The</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel is abit far away from Jogja city, 15-20mins from Malioboro Street, but it is a great hotel to stay in if you want to rejuvenate yourself. Very relaxing and a great place to stay if you do not want to think about work. They have everything from golf course, spa, bicycle tour, swimming pool (with a cool slides), EVERYTHING!  They do have wifi internet, you can still connect if you really need to work haha  Wonderful landscape. Lovely nice Javanese deco.  Kindness staffs ever. They are super polite and very very helpful.  Great variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet style. Very yummy too.  Remember to try out their spa, the yogurt one!  OH! FREE shuttle to&amp; back from Malioboro Street at every hour. GEM!"
"an attractive and convenient hotel for vacation. My first impression of this hotel was warm greeting from the hotel staffs right from beginning until end of my stay. facilities at the hotel are also very adequate and fun, especially swimming pool,spa&amp;golf course. Kemangi Bistro is great place to eat while enjoying natural atmosphere and swimming pool. I really want to visit Hyatt Yogyakarta again, because this hotel is convenient to escaped from my daily activity."
"Hyatt Regency is a very impressive resort. As soon as you walk you can feel the calm atmosphere. The ground is very large and nicely architected with many place up relax. They have a huge swimming pool  (including a water slide). There is also a fishing pond, golf course, spa, live music. The list go on and on. You can spend the whole vacation here.  Room is good but nothing special. You really should be out on the resort ground anyway.  Only two downside. One, its a bit further out from the city. Two, the walkway to exit the hotel property is a bit slippery. So its probably safer to walk on the road. But I guess most people take a cab to get out anyway."
"An ideal base for exploring Jogja.   Incase it gets too hot or rainy you still have your family entertained. Music band at the Bistro is quite good and help you unwind.   Water slides, fishing, horse cart rides - a sure hit amongst the kids.   As mentioned by other reviewers, food is relatively boring. But reach out for the staff, they take efforts to help you. There are sea food restaurants around and are must try. Break fast spread is good and they help with boxed breakfast for your 4 AM tours."
We stayed at the hotel as base to sightsee the Borobudur temple. As well as a great place to do this from it also turned out to be a very relaxing stay and the grounds and pool area were very inviting to just chill out. It is not in the centre of town but we found it easy to arrange transport and get to the local shopping centre. We had access to the Club Lounge and this was a good meeting point for afternoon drinks before going to dinner (if we did not fill up on snacks!). We had some problems with the key cards but if that is all there was wrong it shows it was a good place to base yourself.
"Positive aspects: large selection of HBO-channels (good entertainment), free wi-fi; great pool; nice garden (but too much of it is exclusively for the golf players); friendly staff; good medical service provided by the hotel. Negative aspects: quite cheap but boring food; sometimes inattentive staff (when we were sitting by the pool, nobody ever came to ask if we wanted something to drink); front desk staff pretends to understand english but actually doesn&#39;t; hotel rooms are quite old. For that price you would expect nicer (i. e. newer) rooms and a better trained staff (with respect to the understanding and use of the english language)."
"My stay was excellent from the booking until check out. Fast check in, great selection of foods, extrimely friendly and well trained staff and fabulous view. The best surprise I had was they offered me selection of choice able women amenities in room from nail polish until brush! I&#39;ve been staying in so many hotels but never had this experience before. Bravo Hyatt! You never stop surprising me! I can&#39;t wait to comeback.."
"I&#39;ll be back someday !! So homy,,Friendly,,and Have a great view...golf view,,mount view,,swimming pool and any others...when i felt so bored With my job, my activity ,, and absolutly for the traffic jam..i Miss this place !"
"I was happy to stay in the hotel. Feel like stay in a beautiful palace with Javanese culture touch, with Merapi mountain view. Wide golf course landscape give us wide view, long n winding jogging track. Some swimming-pools for family. Breakfast menu are great, combination of Western, Indonesian, East-Asian tastes. Only weakness, not to close to downtown of Yogyakarta. Very welcome and polite of staffs."
"No doubt The Hyatt delivers excellent services, unfortunately these services can be so streamlined, they lose the character of the environment and culture where their hotels are located. While I enjoyed my stay in their Jogja hotel considerably, I have this suspicion in the back of my head that maybe this would have been a better experience if the Hyatt took in Jogja&#39;s culture and made it more integral to the whole hotel experience. Sure there are the occasional local artworks and woodcarvings in the decor, and local food in the breakfast buffet, but somehow there&#39;s a certain &#39;je ne sais quoi&#39;, a spirit to the city that isn&#39;t in the hotel. Which is a little bit heartbreaking considering the marvelous backdrops and the spectacular scenery in The Hyatt&#39;s landscape."
"After almost one week exploring  beaches, visiting exotic caves, viewing sunrise over Borobudur temple, and enjoying jogjanese cuisines...., Me, my wife, and, son decided to pick this hotel for a rest.  Even though, it is old, The hotel itself is very relaxing, quiet, and have a beautiful garden and surroundings.   We chose a room with a terrace face the pool and the garden. it&#39;s a good choice, we could have our inroom dining or tea time privately there.   The room is large and comfy enough, no complaint about it.  The dining experience, no problem, good ambience especially for the outdoor part, but more local cuisine options would be good to overcome boredome for guests that stay quite long.  Our favorit part is the outdoor activities. The pool is unique and very relaxing, my</span><span>&hellip;"
I recently stayed at this hotel for a company event. I was disappointed with the hotel.  The rooms were very tired. The towels in my room were damp.  The food was average - the restaurant tablecloths and stains on them.   The sheets felt damp. The staff were friendly but the service was nothing special. My company was paying for the event - I would not go back for a personal visit.
"The hotel/resort was fine.  The food was good at both the restaurant and the &quot;Teras&quot;, staff polite &amp; courteous, clean facilities.  The pool and the gardens were really lush and beautiful.  Our overall experience was positive.  One thing we did not realize was how far the hotel is from central Jogja.  It&#39;s written 5km but with the traffic these days it took us nearly one hour (one way) to get to central Jogja/sightseeing.  So it would be a great place to stay if you just want to enjoy the food and hang out at the pool (we loved the slides!) but not a good place if you want to do much sightseeing.  As I wrote above, the staff were polite and courteous, but not really efficient.  I had two complaints about the service:  Check-in was not at all smooth.  We arrived at 12:30 and was</span><span>&hellip;"
"Recently went to this Hyatt facility and was not impressed. Rooms are tried, service is average and really nothing special or worth mentioning.  The room had stains, light tripped and no one once asked how was the stay. Definitely not doing again."
"I visited this hotel during the autumn of 2011, as a part of a workshop that was arranged, therefore some special arrangements were made for our group by the organizers and may not be entirely the normal hotel services.  The room was nice and located on a quiet upper floor, which was appreciated, since i wouldn&#39;t want to be close to water or insects. The humidity in the country makes the rooms smell a little from dampness, but not at all as mold, just humidity. The floor tiles are nice and cool in the hot climate and cleaned well every day. There was an zircon, but after a day or so i didn&#39;t really use it anymore, since it brought in some strange smell into the room, so it was just easier to open the window before bedtime. Due to work, very little time was spent in the room and</span><span>&hellip;"
"The property is very nicely designed. With big lush gardena and golf course. Unfortunately other than that I can&#39;t say many positive thing about my experience in this hotel. Firstly the aircon is in progress of service/maintenance. It&#39;s very hot, not much difference from the crazy hot Jogja with 42degrees temperature outside. The room smells old. When I opened the faucet it seemed clogged and the water spurted to my clothes. When I opened the bath tub faucet, muddy water ran out for almost 30 sec before it cleared out.  The front desk service is slow. The food is not exceptional. The only good thing I can say is the waiters really try to personalize the service. They try to remember our names, and served us very genuinely."
"We were there just for brunch and swimming, they have IDR 130,000 package for brunch and swimming. we really like their sushi, desserts and especially their omelet. After that my husband got sleepy and exchange his change for swimming to take a nap on a sundeck chair, meanwhile i explored the pool by myself and it was great with all the garden view, trees everywhere, perfect sunshine, clean pool. If u&#39;re staying in Yogya and wanna have special weekend u can try it here, cause they only offered this package on Sunday, perfect for family and couple."
One of the best Hyatts we have vistited so far. Really friendly staff who did their utmost to make your stay unforgetable. The room was good and clean. Swimmingpool was fantastic. Even during heavy thunderstorm we enjoyed our drink in the open hotel lounge.There is a complimentary hotelbus to the citycentre.  A must see is the palace of the sultan and the museum Vredenburg.
"I stayed there with my family and very satisfied with their services, such as nice garden view, swimming pool facilities, rich breakfast selection and comfortable rooms. We also enjoyed lunch at the garden restaurant, near the golf course. Hotel staff are all well trained. Hence, this hotel is highly recommended to everybody."
"Hotel has a very nice landscape and pool. It has its own 9 hole golf course. This hotel is really huge. Very nice garden. The downside is room is too old. Leakage from the air conditioning ducting. Furniture has lots of chips, scratches, wear of signs for a long time. For me it&#39;s already time for them to replace many interior and fixtures.   Room is very small. Hard to move in such a small space. Room size is below expectation for a 5 star hotel. Pillow too thin. Blanket not nice. Tv is too small.  Service is good. Breakfast selection is just standard. You have to purchase coupon for wifi. Expensive.  I recommend this place to do renovations."
"Stayed in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta for 3 days. I love how they maintain their gardens and grounds. The room however was alittle old but clean and we are happy with the house keeping services. The safe was alittle faulty but the hotel was very prompt in having it fixed. Please avoid a room which has a connecting door to the next room. We can hear the neighbour in the night especially when they turn up their TV and started talking very loudly on the phone. Generally, most of their hotel and restaurant staff were quite friendly but sadly we did experienced some impatience with two of the front desk staff."
"I stayed at this hotel in late March with my family. This hotel is about an hour drive to Borobudur, so it is convenient for sightseeing. I used the club lounge and the staff was so friendly that I could extend check out time. The hotel area was so large and its pool was fabulous. I had dinner in the restaurant. The response of the staff was a bit slow, but the taste of meal was very delicious. I enjoyed Javanese couisine so much. All in all, I was very satisfied with the stay."
"This was my second visit to the Hyatt at Yogyakarta (my first was a business trip - as you can see this is a hardship posting). While the rooms are a bit old, the pool is amazing. The boys spent all of their time on the water-slide, which is build to resemble the temples we visited earlier in the day. My wife and I enjoyed the long swim around areas passing under the bridges and the cool water was great after the heat we faced walking around the main temple sites.  The nine hole golf course is picturesque and the caddies were nice enough not to laugh at our poor golfing skills.  We did have a small problem getting put bags brought up to the room, but a quick word with the manger fixed that and he even gave us club access as compensation for the poor service.  The meals in the</span><span>&hellip;"
"This was my second stay at Jogja&#39;s Hyatt. My family have always loved the beautiful grounds, rooms and public spaces (lobby, swimming pool, ponds, etc). Everything was being kept luxurious.. Born and bred in the chaotic Jakarta, staying in the calm and green hotel was quite an experience. It was a treat being able to wake up in the morning, taking a jog on the green hotel grounds. The only (but most importantly) minor was the staff:   - Check-in was sloooow as a snail. Booked 3 rooms for our party of 7, and the 2nd &amp; 3rd rooms needed 3 hours (no joke!) to be ready. - Breakfast was chaotic. They had offered various kinds of teas, all of which needed 45mins the least to get to our table.  -  One of the room was not well cleaned during our 2nd day there.  To be fair we did stay</span><span>&hellip;"
"I went there last month. The staff are great, polite and have been very helpful during our stay. The view outside our window was also breath-taking. Surely will come back again to Jogja &amp; i recommend this hotel."
"this is my second stay after 6 years ago. this time i stayed at executive room hoping that this hotel already upgraded or else. but its disapointing. nothing change except tv change to lcd. the hospitality is as javanesse standard, warm and helpful. breakfast is ok with many choices, but it needs 15 minutes just to take a cup of coffe. just similar experience with 6 years ago."
"I am writing this review with a heavy heart. I love Hyatt chain and I have been a loyal customer for a few years, being Diamond for the past 5 or 6 years. But my recent stay here leaves me disappointed.  The hotel is located slightly outside of town. The staff is polite, courteous, but the physical property leaves a lot to be desired. This hotel needs a major renovation as soon as possible.  The rooms smell of mold/mildew, the mattress lumpy, bed linens damp, pillows flat. On Sunday at 5:30AM I was awaken by noise from the Regency Club Lounge staff, since my room was apparently right under the lounge.  I was supposed to stay for 2 nights at this hotel, but after 1 night, decided to pack and move to another hotel that has just opened. The difference is night and day - and the</span><span>&hellip;"
"I have been to the beaitiful Jogja and have stayed in a few 4-5 stars hotels. I must say the standard in Hyatt Jogjakarta is simply amazing. i had a room that faced the majestic Merapi and that was really an experience. The food is excellent and so are the other facilities such as the swimming pool. But, above all, I was impressed by the high standard of customer service of all levels from the staff. Now, I will not consider staying anywhere else in Jogakarta."
"The first impression when we talk about Yogyakarta is the hospitality and the great heritage of Javanese Culture. When I got there, those two impression showed directly ... no doubt about that. As a solo traveler I could do anything I want, went wherever I want .... freedoooooom or should I say escaping from the routines ? That&#39;s the point I want to share with you. There is only one choice for place to stay in Yogyakarta  to complete my mission ... that would be Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta. Many facilities support me to get my goals ( hotel location, pool, nice view of Merapi etc ). For some moment I feel I live in some other world ... ha ha ha ... the hospitality of the staffs ... ? no question about that. Hospitality is inside their blood ..... I had no complain for the room</span><span>&hellip;"
"Warm welcome, Warm hospitality from the staff, unique design, feel like stay out from the city, lovely food, quite near to many interest place near YOgyakarta. Surely I will be returned back to this hotel if I drop to Yogyakarta again."
The hotel is very nice. the hospitality ....always smiling staff.... The staffs are very friendly yet polite to all the guests. they all very helpful and friendly staff specially for Ms. Asti Dewi who assist us to arrange a tour to Borbodur and other activities for our weekend gateway!  Overall services are excellent and we love to stay there again when we travel to Yogyakarta another time. Thanks Ms Asti Dewi
This is a great hotel with wonderful pool and landscape view.... Specially for lovely assisting from all crew..... Very big thank you to Ms. Yuli at regency lounge for warmest greeting. Food was great specially for hot stone steak it was awesome !!!!  I will not hesitate to return sleepover in hyatt if i go jogja again.... see u soon !!!!
Did not realize how good the service and this hotel was until I stayed away from it more than normal.  This is definitely the best service you will get in Indonesia and with unbelievable grounds and a fantastic pool to lay around by.  Great view of Volcano Merapi from the hotel as well as from the top terrace.  Extremely friendly and prompt staff.  It felt like I should have never left.
"We had a wonderful time here with the family, well located to visit Merapi and Borobodor. Kids loved the pool (and slide), good golf course and food was excellent. Staff were very friendly. Rooms are probably a little small and outdated but we didnt spend much time in the room."
"I brought my family for holiday on March 9-12, 2013 and stayed in the adjoined club rooms. We were impressed by the description in its website, but when we were there, what had been described were not all true. We liked the quite surroundings and the warm services by the staffs. However, we were disappointed by the room facilities, especially AC that could not be made colder (the temperature was locked at 20-22 degree C, probably, to save cost). The room was not protected from UV so the room was not cold enough for us. The foods were also terrible, particularly breakfast. Nothing specials, in terms of variety nor taste. All in all, we feel that the hotel was not worth the price."
"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogya as a group of 3 couples, ourselves and our parents (both inlaws and parents).  As the hotel was fully booked during our stay, only one of the rooms available to us was on Club Regency, therefore only 1 room came with breakfasts.  But the manager Maji and his team were very understanding, not to mention they were very kind and attentive to our needs, and have kindly offered complementary breakfasts for the other two couples in regular rooms.  We enjoyed our stay in Yogya very much thanks to the great customer service from Hyatt Regency Yogya.  I&#39;d definite recommend anyone going to Yogya to stay here, not only for the wonderful ambience, most importantly the wonderful staff here."
"I moved to the Hyatt Regency Yogya from another hotel and was so pleased I did. The Hotel has beautiful vistas with excellent friendly staff and an amazing pool, with a long winding slippery slide.  I booked a room with access to the Regency Club, I had breakfast there in every morning. The complementary evening cocktails and hot and cold dishes were really appreciated, especially the cocktails as Yogya doesn&#39;t have any alcohol stores (and I did try to find one - and Cirlce K only sold beer and pre-mixed drinks) and buying a bottle of basic spirits through the hotel was around US$100-130!   The staff in the Regency Club were all brilliant (and more generally all the staff), especially the morning host, Merrilyn, and the evening host, whose name I unfortunately have forgotten.</span><span>&hellip;"
Excellent as usual. Very friendly and hard working staff. They all seemed to know my name which was simply amazing. All interaction was very plesant and helpfull. One thing need to be improved is the pool deck needs some work but I believe is being addressed. I will definitely return.
"It is not the first time to visit Jogja, but Hyatt Regency give different memories that I ever had during my travel. The service is very good, every staff are willing to help the guest, with delicious food, beatiful view and great facilities. For the next visit to jogja, I promise to choose Hyatt as priority to stay if the room available."
"We unknowingly visited Yogyakarta during the Javanese New Year.  The Hyatt Regency would not normally have been our first choice but there was very little available so we ended up staying here.   We were very pleasantly surprised with the Hyatt Regency.  The staff was very attentive, possibly too much at times but they were so sweet that it made us laugh.  The rooms were not too bad, we even had a private patio off of our room.      The grounds at this hotel are fantastic!  I think there were at least 4 pools and the gardens were very, very beautiful.    The food at the hotel was not that great.  We dined at the restaurant as well as had room service on a couple of occasions.  The choice for food in Yogyakarta is fairly dismal and it can be a huge pain to get anywhere because</span><span>&hellip;"
"I spent my holiday together with my family in this hotel last January, and i&#39;ve got a word for this hotel..&quot;awesome&quot;.Though it is located a bit far from the downtown, but still, i love staying in this hotel. I can say that because i got more than i expected before. I love the beautiful mountain view from my window and the fresh morning breeze which i got when i opened my door in the balcony. The services were great, the hospitality and the facilities are good, too. But somehow, it would be much better if we can get free access on the internet. :)"
I frequent Yogyakarta regularly and Hyatt is definitely the best there is. The place is beautiful and the view from my room is always spectacular. The best thing about Hyatt would definitely have to be the service! The staff were always smiling and ready to assist me with anything at all.
"A friend recommended this hotel. The rate is quite high for such rooms, i have to admit. But there&#39;s a lot more to see in Hyatt Yogyakarta. A beautiful landscapes just as my friend told me, its really refreshing. Sitting in the garden with golf view and bamboo trees in the background and read a book definitely a great way to relax after working 15 hours a day. The wind, the smell of the trees, the bird sound, this is heaven! Forget about dated rooms, they are nothing compared to this and un tiring smile from all the staff all the way. Among all, this is definitely my favourite hotel in Yogyakarta. Definitely will following my friends recommending this hotel so they can have the same feeling i had. Bravo Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta!"
Always get Good Room even via SMS boooking via Mr Renzo and special hospitality in club lounge With Melryna. The food and The wine is Gold. Gifts always waiting in The Room. Smile always accompany The greeting With your name. No black out during Peak seasons.
"We had our honeymoon here in 2001 and it is an amazing hotel. The service was superb, I didnt want to leave!  We were married across the road from here (my wife is from Yogyakarta). I&#39;ll always remember having a late night meal by the swimming pool both still wearing our bridal wear to the amusment of the guests.  Great view of the golf course on the top floor and I will always cherish our stay here."
"The best asset of the Hyatt Regency Jogjakarta is its staff, who are ever smiling and who exude warm, cheerful service.  The grounds are verdant and well-maintained.  But its age is starting show in the frayed corners, mouldy baths in the spa, and visible wear-and-tear on the facilities.  The rooms are spartan by Hyatt standards.  There is no alarm clock in sight, access to the shower is via a precarious climb into the steep bath, and the in-room safe is so shallow that it can accommodate only one laptop.  Cold, austere tiles overlay the flooring.  The expansive swimming pools, surrounded by lush gardens and an abundance of deck chairs, somewhat offset the austere guest accommodations.  Taking inspiration from Borobudur, Indonesia‚Äôs most visited monument, which is about an hour</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed 2 nights during weekend for Office Gathering. It&#39;s a nice hotel, rooms are clean, friendly and helpful staffs. The entire site is also comforting with a lovely view of Gunung Merapi. The cafe and bar called Boogie Teras is also good for just hanging out at night, with great life music. The gold course is nice. Highly recommended for family stay.  But... the location is a little bit far from the city centre. Taking into account the traffic, it takes about 40 minutes to Keraton / Malioboro street.  Here comes the worst about the hotel... the foods unbelievably taste so bad, be it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner... My advise to the GM : GET A GOOD CHEF, PLEASE..!! it shouldn&#39;t be difficult, since Jogjakarta is quite famous with its foods and culinary."
"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.  I was a bit concerned about staying after we read some of the reviews.  We used points to upgrade to a club level room- free breakfast and cocktails- worth it.  The hotel grounds are indeed spectacular.  The pool was great and the waterslide kept our daughter amused.  The room was big enough and it was a flat screen tv.   Yes it is showing some signs of wear- the furniture fabric was stained and worn looking and the furniture was out of date.  To big and heavy looking.    I can&#39;t really fault the room but I would definitely say it wasn&#39;t a 5 star.  A big complaint is that there was only a 3 hr complimentary wifi per day.    Really??!!    The food at the hotel was okay, nothing bad nor great.   The spa was reasonable priced and nice but not</span><span>&hellip;"
"when we stay at Hyatt Jogja it&#39;s very enjoyable, i just checking in and the staff is very nice, warm and friendly to welcoming us. they can remember our name.. and they very helpful. i especially very excited at Bogeys Terrace they have wonderful atmosphere which near golf course very fresh.."
"I visited this hotel for the second time in 8 years, and the hotel remains as good place as before. Thanks to large pools with waterslides, this hotel must be a very attractive place for family vacationers. There is on site 9 hole golf course, but it&#39;s par 30 course not par 36. I recommend golfers to look for other courses outside hotel. Overall, this hotel is a good value hotel."
"I visit Yogyakarta every month for business. I like stay at Hyatt although the location far from my factory. My bussines so busy, so I need quite hotel to refresh my body for next day. Nice stay with good view room, service, and staff make me want to come back. Please keep the garden because I never found that likes in Hyatt Yogyakarta."
Stayed there was awesome. Landscape is green so lovely and peaceful. Main enterance and the flower which gave to us upon arrived was great. All the agents at front desk were helpfully. Thanks! And we would like to comeback cos of the pool. Hyatt is the best home for my holiday in Yogya.
"This hotel sits in a middle of a very pristine garden featuring a large pools and... A 9 holes golf course.  The atmosphere is very nice and the staff very helpful with the now famous Indonesian ubiquitous smile .... You will be 45 minutes by car from Borobudur , Prambanan and other Temples,  King Palaces  or simply wonderful Mother nature.. This is a 2/3 days no brainer!"
Best atmosphere. Pools are amazing. Gardens are amazing. Staff were amazing. Rooms were amazing. The only bad thing was that I never wanted to leave the hotel to do my activities. Far too comfortable.
"Surounding with the beautiful and panoramic view with many awesome gardens and golf area, Hyatt Yogya has a very good and enjoyable ambience. Fantastic swimming pool for kids and adults, but in the holiday season, the pool will be very crowded with people and difficult to get towel. Many options for breakfast in a nice restaurant, you may sitting inside or take table outside facing the pool. Everything was excellent in this hotel, except the bedroom. The bedroom was small, the furniture looks old, and the bathroom is very average for the 5-star Hyatt. But who cares, we are in Yogya, get out of bedroom and enjoy the ambiance."
"I was staying there on New Year&#39;s eve. The grounds and pools were awesome although it tends to be crowded on the weekend.They have children activities such as fishing, cycling and local horse carriage to bring you around the village. I would definitely comeback someday!"
"The hotel is showing signs of wear, some things need upgrading. The health club is minuscule and dangerously hot! But the pool and grounds are wonderful. I would recommend you taking the trip to the historical temple 25 miles away to make this a memorable trip. The concierge can help out."
"We stayed 4 nights at  the hotel and this is a nice place.  Though, compared with other Hyatt hotels, there is a huge difference.  The grounds (garden, golf, swimming pools) are wonderful and hard to beat.  Also the personnel is doing its best, though some of the service flaws are really unforgivable like :  * we had an very early morning departure and reserved a hotel car to bring us to the airport.  Reservation got lost and there was no car.  Took 15 minutes to get a public taxi there.  * we wanted to print out our boarding passes in the Customer service center.  Took 3 hours to get it done.  Email with the boarding passes was sent several times, though not received.  After I took a look at their computer, I noticed that Hyatt was not receiving email anymore in 24hours.  Then</span><span>&hellip;"
"This is truly a spectacular hotel.  From its service, ambience and amenities, it is one of the best if not the best.  Thoroughly enjoy my stay here over the New Year weekend.  The firework display on NYE just seems to go on forever.  Love it.  It also provides a shuttle service to Malioboro town centre.  Oh yes a must try would be the spa massage!  A client recommends this wonderful hotel for my stay.  Hence it is only right that I strongly recommend it to anyone who is in Yogjakarta for a visit or holiday.  Excellent"
"Gorgeous and well manicured landscapes, excellent service, very polite and helpful staff that call you by your first name, meaning that they remember each and every one of their guest&#39;s name. The various swimming pools sizes and shapes, add a decorative touch to the gardens. However, for a five star hotel as this one is, the rooms are in dire need of some upgrade work to be able to meet the authentic standards of a 5* hotel.  What can one do in 30 minutes on the net, in today&#39;s digital world where everything is done electronically?? Well, that is exactly the time the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta offers on their wi-fi complimentary service when staying in a standard room. Of course one has the choice of buying extra time, which by the way, is not cheap and once started, it cannot be</span><span>&hellip;"
"For one thing: it has a gorgeous landscape, beautiful garden and a golf course. But to make a good hotel, let alone a 5 star hotel there is more to it. The rooms are just below standard for a 5 star hotel. Guests these days bring laptops, mobile phones, cameras, etc. so they need power to reload their equipment. I was staying in the executive floor, but the room has- believe it or not ‚Äì ONE power outlet! Come on Hyatt this is 2012! The rooms are plainly boring and worse: the stone floors make it unattractive and cold. As I previously said in one of my earlier contributions for me to make a hotel a superb one is to have it perfect on all aspects, from the quality of the bed, pillows, bathroom (I was first brought to a ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù room with a shower IN the bad, I really don‚Äôt like</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed in this hotel last week for one night. This is a nice and very well maintained hotel. The staffs are polite and helpful, our bedroom and bathroom always clean &amp; tidy, The breakfast buffet are also good. This hotel has a large and beautiful garden with swimming pools."
"This is the second time we stay for vacation. We are after the golf (9 hole, par 30 course) and the pools with &quot;s&quot;, there are literally a number of pools in the center of this hotel which is great fun for the kids. Golf is great, course is well maintained, green grass is slow but all else is perfect. Water pressure in the showers thorughout hotel  is very strong, we love it! Tried the sauna (v hot but small), jacuzzi (again strong water pressure but v small) and cold water pool (v cold but also tiny). Gym is new located by one of the pools, new equipments but again miniscule in size compared to the hotel overall size (2 treadmills, 1 bike, 1 set of the multitraining set, room could not be more than 6x6??).   Stayed in the regency club, room is small, bed and pillows are flat!</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed a few times here,trying regency club for the first time since we are staying  with toddler.the standard room was small the last time we came. Service wise this hotel is excellent, our check in was handled separately in the club lounge. Room still small according to our standard and definitely need renovation since the furniture looks old even after they upgrade to flat tv.not to mentioned the faded towel. Luckily it is clean. Room service, nasi goreng kampung and satay is nice even though portion can be improved for the price they charged. Pool is big but raining the whole day.kid loves the feeding fish activities-bread courtesy of the hotel.shuttle to town malioboro is good so you can buy groceries and souvenir. 3 hours free internet daily (counting down from the time</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed in this hotel several years ago with family. The room was good but not so special. But the swimming pool is awesome,consists of slide and small waterfall. Surrounded by golf yard, make the air is so fresh also. The minus point of it is location. It&#39;s little bit far from any interesting places, such as malioboro, royal palace, shopping mall, etc. Maybe this hotel is fit for business and golfer only, instead of for tourist or city explorer."
"I used a hotel by traveling alone. The hotel was a very clean ,beautiful.   Hotel&#39;s staff is very kind. The kind woman staff escorted me. When I  cant find a menu of the room service , the kind and smiley wonderful man staff helped me.  This hotel is very good. If I go to the Yogyakarta again, I use this hotel.  "
"This was my first time staying in this hotel. I have a Hyatt Gold Passport and comparing the other Hyatt hotels i have stayed in, this might be the worst. The location is not too close with the famous Malioboro street, but quite near if u want to to Prambanan. About the room is small, very outdated with dark lighting ambience and the washroom amenities is look so poor and cheap for 5 star hotel. The television in my room, they still use an old crt 21&quot; television. I think the hotel is trying to keep the &quot;traditional&quot; feel, but for the most expensive 5* hotel, is not good enough.  However the hotel is very close to some nice restaurants along the road, u can find shabu2 restaurant, ikan bakar, japanese restaurant are in walking distance because the breakfast varieties was also</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed here for four nights, mostly because there was a large pool, and tennis courts. We have three active kids, and wanted a bit of space for them to run. Along those lines, the hotel worked for us... though the tennis courts surface needs to be redone, as it&#39;s slippery, and frankly a bit dangerous. The pool is great, huge, and the water slide provided at least... 2 hours? or entertainment for the boys everyday.   Food was average... breakfast buffet decent but nothing great. Rooms were a bit small, but were inter-joining, so that was good. Internet steep at 15$ a day, but to be expected at this type of hotel. Golf course seemed okay, though we didn&#39;t play, and it was mostly for well-heeled Jakarta types and wealthy locals.   The ride into town was 15 minutes with little</span><span>&hellip;"
"Very nice hotel, again most everybody was extremely friendly.  Had to go through security to get in, which is nice.  I had a couple of knocks against them.  The floors of the rooms are tile.  So i had a lady wearing heels walking around at 5am and woke me up.  I would highly recommend either staying on a top floor, or asking for a room with nobody above you.  It was pretty loud.  Their are no plugs that work for American computers.  So make sure you have adaptors, you can get 1 from the regency club lounge as well.  The wines in the lounge were from Bali, and were so-so.  They must spend a fortune keeping the grounds up, and it is a beautiful place.  Internet - they give you 3 free hours if you&#39;re in regency club room.  I think it&#39;s 30 minutes for regular room.  But the time</span><span>&hellip;"
Get the rooms on level 1 which open up to the gardens. Cleanliness and service excellent. Price wise of course on the upside. Channels on TV many to choose. Food however is as expected hotelish - bit bland and ho-hum. Location wise about 30 minutes from airport. Pool was scenic. 9 hole golf course available though not at all of any interest to me - people hitting a small white ball over and over again still boggles my mind. All in all the hotel is worthy of a Hyatt.
"First the good:  This hotel is gorgeous.  It sits on superbly manicured lawns with one of the best pools we have ever visited.  The waterslide through the mini temple is especially cool.  We loved the exterior and the beautiful entrancewasy surrounded by fish.  Then we got to our room, quite a let down.  The rooms are NOT/NOT 5 star standards.  We paid extra for the Deluxe and the while the balcony is beautiful the rest of the room is a 3 star in the US, and an OLD 3 star at that.  Simple tile floor and plastic shower/tub, very dissapointing after seeing hhow gorgeous the outside is.  But then came the true let down...the food!  I dont understand how the cooks can make food that is soo bland!  My family and I currently live in Indoensia and love Indonesian food, but this menu</span><span>&hellip;"
"To be honest, I m little bit dissapointed when the frst time i checked-in, the room still mess!! they haven&#39;t clean up the room, really shocked!!! i asked them to change another room! and for the apology from the hotel, they prepared me a private car+driver and drove me to malioboro road, next day in the morning, a staff delivered me cookies with an apology letter from the assistant manager (how sweet). Generally, i liked to stay in this hotel, had good time, even thou i&#39;m a bit dissapointed for the service at the beginning, but i would still like to recommend this hotel :) and i like the swimming pool!! Lovely"
"Having arrived at the Hyatt Regency from the Grand Hyatt Jakarta, I was disappointed.  For some reason check in was so slow, 20 - 25mins slow!  It was at night and there was one family being checked in by 3 members of staff.  I dont know if it is normal, but we were asked to sit and wait, we were provided with a refreshing drink as we waited.  I could not understand the delay at all and the level of English spoken wasn&#39;t sufficient to elaborate.  My room was also a let down, much more like a 3* North American hotel than I expected,  I was close to Bogey&#39;s Teras and the loud singing and music was annoying and disrupted my rest.  It took 3 phone calls to the front desk before I could be understood that I needed another room, the duty manager did swiftly move me to another room</span><span>&hellip;"
"A good quality hotel with a 9-hole golf course located right next by. Staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and no hiccups occured during a 1-night business stay. The gym is small but clean and well-equipped, the pool area seems nice and well-maintained conveying an impression of Bali. Small shortcoming is that WiFi is free of charge only for 30 minutes, a lamentable policy still applied by some of the major chain hotels."
"I visited this hotel, almost 3 - 4 years ago.  It was an awesome experience to sleep in Hyatt Regency Jogja, where a right place to take a break from daily habit.  The gardens were awesome, and I like the swimming pool.  It&#39;s divided to 2 parts, the one is salty-pool and the other one is the normal.  Honestly, I broke the Jacuzzi by clicking the buttons.  I&#39;m so sorry. --&quot;  But, the room was good; spacious enough for my family, and we enjoyed this.  Superb.  However, when we&#39;re looking for playing-area, (it&#39;s our stupidity) we thought the area was a playground; but it&#39;s a lawn, with trees where you can play games there.  Disappointed with that thing.  Only that."
"We were planning to go to Solo after staying in this hotel. In fact, after we check in, we decided o cancel all the bookings to Solo because Hyatt Yogya is so amazing and nice place. The kids were swimming all times, we also spend time to bike around the hotel through the paddy field. We stay in two rooms in the regency club, and we love all over the place including the afternoon tea provided with traditional javanese food and delicacies. We also liked to walk through the golf course, having little exercise around the hotel. The rooms are clean, well managed. The entry point of the hotel displayed interesting panoramic view."
"When we checked in (we came in group but were divided in different arrival time and it was only 6 of us), it takes them pretty long to process and have the key handed to us. The room is small and has looked pretty old. Complimentary Free wifi in the room only for 30min everyday. ¬†Ask the receptionist on how to connect.   I like the bath rope as it is light (not heavy like most), cotton-made, batik-pattern and shorter than usual, so I can wear it for sleeping.  The pool and garden are great. Jogging track is actually pathway with longest track as far as 2km with nice view. Running at 5.30am is bright enough on September.   I like the24-hour fitness center concept although it only has 2 treadmill and 1 elliptical machines. It has small bathroom in the fitness center.  At least I</span><span>&hellip;"
"For business purposes Hyatt is one of my preferred hotel operators, with the Park Hyatt being the most suited for non-business travel. Therefore I admit to have been slightly sceptical when booking a three day stay at the Hyatt Regency - unnecessarily though, since the hotel did offer Park Hyatt standard in in some respect even better.  We were staying in a Deluxe room with garden view, totally sufficient for two with easy to access internet. All was clean and neat, we could not complain about leftovers or dirty corners. The breakfast buffet was exceptional for Indonesian standards, in my view the best we got on our four week trip including some other 5star hotels. Asian soup is prepared on demand, so are all egg dishes - the ASian corner with DimSums etc is offering plenty of</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel has a very nice landscape. I like the greenery, walking path, golf course and swimming pool.  My kid enjoys the slider at the swimming pool and had a lot of fun with other kids.  The room is quite old and the quality of mattress is not as my expectation standard for Hyatt hotel. The bathroom floor is slippery and should be renovated. The bath towels are so old and not a white, should consider to be replaced with new towels. Bathroom amenities quality are poor. Staffs are friendly but will not inform you all the details. We stayed at the club room where we were inform we can use 3 hours free internet access per day same as normal guest. I cannot log on the next day and found out later that the system set it to count 24 hours.  If we were told about the 3 hours for</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed here on my honeymoon.  Let me start by saying the hotel is beautiful and the staff are incredibly polite and courteous, as nearly all Indonesian people seem to be.  Furthermore the swimming pool is immense and the slide good fun too. My grip with the hotel, as it were, is attributable to the Hyatt policies, which seem horrendously out of place in a country that is so refreshingly honest.  Please see examples below:  1) Wifi access.  They tell you at reception you have 2 hours access per day when you arrive.  What they fail to tell you is that the clock starts ticking from the very moment you log on!  And if you get disconnected, as you do frequently, then you can&#39;t even log back on.  Effectively you had your chance.  Following that you must pay excessive premiums to</span><span>&hellip;"
"we stayed here for 3 nights, the rooms were nice and well equipped.  staff was very friendly and helpful.  the grounds are nice, the pool closes somewhat early and there are no lights if you want to swim after the sun sets.  The food was the most disappointing, we ate in the restaurant one night and the food had no taste.  the breakfast buffet offered a lot but the quality was not what I would expect from a Hyatt."
"Have to agree with all the positive reviews.  The hotel is worth visiting just for the beautiful lay-out and decor.  Rooms were clear and well appointed ; service was attentive, although slow at times.  Internet was included in our room-rate and worked well.  Breakfast was expansive, but menu options during other meals were limited for us since we are vegetarians.  The location away from the bustle of Yogyakarta center was a big plus for us.  We took the hotel shuttle to Malioboro on one day and found it very convenient.  Day-trip to Borobudur, Prambanan and Plaosan temples was the highlight of the trip.  Yogyes website has a wealth of information about Yogyakarta and surrounding areas and I was able to arrange transportation via e-mail just the day before.  Negatives:   1.</span><span>&hellip;"
"We only had 2 days/1 night here but it was definatley the right choice. We stayed in a club room which was fine and the club lounge lovely (it didn&#39;t open until 10am though). The landscaping is beautiful, it&#39;s nice to feel the character of the country you&#39;re in even if you&#39;re staying at a hotel that is part of a large chain. Breakfast was lovely a real full spread. However it was the staff that made it special for us. They really went out of their way to ensure you had what you needed, they made us feel very welcome. Their language skills were amazing, the breakfast staff would go from English to Japanese to Dutch (or maybe German?) with ease. The tour desk &#39;Angsa&#39; really helped us out of a pickle, having been let down by another company and the guys Hawid our guide and Deede</span><span>&hellip;"
"this hotel is superb in view because they have golf course,beautiful swimming pool and little temples so you can take picture with good scene. this hotel have many rooms but i suggest you take regency club because room is more bigger and near garden (1st floor). hotel location is not near malioboro because it takes 25 minutes from this hotel to go to maliobro but they have shuttle car which stand by every hour  to malioboro or you can go to malioboro using taxi. when we stayed in this hotel last year they didn&#39;t have fitness center."
"We had a wonderful couple of days at the Hyatt. The hotel was very clean, room was comfortable, staff very attentive.  It is a lovely oasis away from the all the traffic and noise of the city. The pool and surrounding gardens are amazing."
Stayed at this hotel on Aug 2012 during a business trip. Friendly staff. Very well maintained and clean facilities. The green surroundings of the hotel were just awesome.  Room was very clean with very nice bed and pillows. Abundant supply of complimentary fruits.  Room&#39;s balcony was designed so that the notion of total privacy and seclusion from the surrounding. Very neat..!  Kemangi Bistro restaurant served good food. Try the hot stone steaks when you have a chance.  Took advantage of the hotel&#39;s golf course facility. The course was very well maintained. Friendly staff. If you think that the course plays easy because the holes are short; think again. The undulations on the greens make the course challenging yet fun.  Enjoyed it immensely.  Some things to improve: lighting</span><span>&hellip;
"It was the second time we stayed at this hotel and it was even better than the first one. We stayed the club room facing the golf field, and we got free cocktail in the afternoon at the club lobby. Our breakfast was supposedly separated in the club lobby, but we didnt want it and preferred to eat at the usual restaurant downstairs. The difference is that, if you eat at the club lobby, usually they serve western food, but at downstairs they serve many indonesian options, which I recommend. You need to mention this during check in.   The maintenance of the hotel is amazing, everywhere is so clean.  The swimming pool is great both for kids and adult.   The food in the restaurant is more than great, it was excellent.   The service is great, always making you feel absolutely</span><span>&hellip;"
"Me, my husband and my daughter checked in at Hyatt July 5th. We liked the hotel, staffs and the grounds is beautiful. We loved every bits of it at the Hyatt. My only problem is that  the room next door to ours  (room 507) making too much noise. Seems to me the whole floors is from the same family (big family). They were making too much noise, kids running around, screaming, parents talking on the phone loudly with the room doors open, maids same as the kids! We complained to the front desk about the noise since we can&#39;t even sit in peace in our room. Yes, the security  did came and try to solve the problem and inform the guest of the noise from the kids. However, after the complained they still didn&#39;t bother to control the kids. I highly recommend Hyatt to try to check in people</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed at hyatt for 4 nights in a club room and 1 night in a regular one. Club room is much nicer, bigger, better location, plus can use the club during the day and eves. Food is good plus they offer local/imported beer, NZ/French wine and snacks. Very good value for money. Hotel itself has large clean grounds, very clean inside, nice staff, life music at both bars. On Sunday watched Ramayana dance with local food. Good considering the price: about $20pp. We stayed with kids and really enjoyed it. It was very nice each time to come back after a whole day of exploring and driving to the temples and Dieng to a nice clean place. I would not stay anywhere else in Jogya (Phoenix area is way too crowded and traffic is insane everywhere). I am not sure what people are looking for in a</span><span>&hellip;"
"The Hyatt Regency in Yog Yakarta is without doubt one of the best hotel expereicnes I have had in Asia.  The hotel is 5 star and is very good value for money.  You will feel completely relaxed as soon as you enter the foyer.  Attention to detail is everywhere.  When you combine the hotel experience with the lovely 9 hole golf course within the hotel grounds, it is just a great place to stay if you are travelling to Yog Yakarta.  You will not be disappointed."
"Staff service was excellent, great local food service at breakfast buffet..... second time staying at this hotel, impressed as always. Very hospitable staff....... a bit out of the city, the entire set up is more like a resort than an average hotel, tranquil location....."
"A friend of ours recommended this hotel for its value and we had an amazing experience ! In fact, for the price, I was really impressed ! At first, the warm welcome they give us with a cold tower, fresh juice cocktail and flower necklaces was setting the standard for our stay. It was a very nice attention and we felt like we were on our honeymoon ! The room was small but very nice, however the bathroom was a bit average.  The hotel grounds are beautiful: the gardens, the outdoor sitting area, the pools, even a water-slide coming out of a fake ruin ! The breakfast was very good, a lot of choices and our table right next to the pool, under a beautiful tree, was just perfect.  We had a wonderful stay in Yogyakarta visiting Borobudur and Prambanan temples."
"I stayed here in October 2011 but I have delayed submitting this review because I thought it was too long; however, I really do want to recommend The Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta, which didn‚Äôt even exist 16 years ago when I last went to this wonderful city in Central Java. The hotel is situated on the fringes of Yogyakarta and set in beautifully landscaped gardens. From the Panorama Roof Terrace, there are stunning views of Mount Merapi (the sacred mountain of Java), Merabu Mountain and some of Java&#39;s beautiful landscape. For other trips outside, think about Borobodur and Prambanan temples, the Sultan‚Äôs Palace and Mount Merapi.  Travelling from my home in Bali, I had only two airlines from which to choose and Lion Air was quickly ruled out because of the anti-social times of</span><span>&hellip;"
"Spent a night when I was at Jogja.  The room was clean, big bed but the decor was a bit antique which I don&#39;t mind.  The complimentary breakfast was good, wide variety of selection and the staff was helpful and friendly.  The thing that I like most about this hotel was the swimming pool! It was huge, it has water slide and waterfalls.  I would recommend this hotel and it won&#39;t go wrong when you&#39;re in Jogja."
"my room was 620 and 622 it was small yet adequated,bed was ok, not that high because only 7 floor.The hotel was lovely and well kept,it was old outdated hotel but the amenities was good and Ac was cool,bathroom is ok. The linen and towel were old,the food at breakfast was good,quality of food is good,we ate lunch once with kids menu calamary and nasi goring was good,my ayam bakar was good and the soup buntut was excellent,clear and non fat. i was agitataed when i ask for concierge for check inn and booking seat my garuda flight,but after back and forth finally the do it free of charge(guest service was confused about their job) overall i would stay again because the pool was fun and free andong ride is good also for my kids."
"I love this hotel. It was one of the best moment during my recent visit to Jogja. The staff, the food, the vie, the ambiance, all brilliant..really satisfied. The only disadvantage is the hotel is quite far from the city centre. Will visit again."
"We stayed here for 4 nights during our stay in Yogyakarta. We booked via the hotel transport to pick us up from the airport. On arrival there was someone ready to meet us and took our luggage and showed us to the car waiting to take us. The journey took approx. 20-30 mins.  On arrival we were given a cold drink as well as a flower garland over our heads which was nice. We sat down and were checked in. The check process seemed very straight forward, but looking back, we weren‚Äôt given much information. Firstly I was sure our breakfast was included in the price, but they told me it wasn‚Äôt. It was charged to us at $12 per person, per night.   There is also a lounge on level 2 which we were not told about even though we are Hyatt Regency God Card Members.  E.g. we could have access</span><span>&hellip;"
"Set in perfectly manicured, luxurious green gardens, the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta is one of those hidden jewels for the business traveler, temple tourist or golf aficionado alike. Families and kids can enjoy the pools and water-slide; Bogeys outdoor bar / resto serves quality food &amp; beverages but the live music might not always suit your mood. From the GM through all levels, the staff are friendly, helpful, efficient, hospitable and happy. Special requests are a breeze.  The Exec Lounge staff are top class while the cocktail hour food &amp; wine may leave a little to be desired at times but the setting is premium with great views of the links and grounds.  Breakfast is a smorgasbord of tastes at Kemangi Bistro and should please all.  Every guest is adorned with a fragrant</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed here for 10 days, it&#39;s just superb, all green around, beautiful swimmingpools, golf course, and very good food. The Hotel director is really nice and friendly, always around to have a little chat with you. Hotel personeel is really friendly and always there for helping you. Really nicce holiday with my family."
"Like the title suggests, this hotel was good, but not great. The grounds and hotel lobby were gorgeous! Elaborate stone tile throughout and an amazing pool area. Even had a sweet pool slide coming out of a mini bourobudor temple :) Pros - extensive pool area - price - good service and food - beautiful common areas  Cons - pool chairs had no cushion and were not comfortable to lay on - room was very outdated. They need new bedding,new grout, new floors...new everything! Reminded me of a cheap beach hotel room - the location was not very conducive to just walking around "
"We have stayed in many Hyatt properties, but the one in Yogyakarta was truly delightful. The genuinely friendly staff, and the great room, with its own small private terrace was perfect. It was like having one&#39;s own private garden on Eden! Since we are vegetarians, the staff at the various restaurants very quickly provided us with a huge range of dishes: local as well as international, that added to the superb experience. The city itself, is a hertiage location, and the amazing temperament of the people who preserved total equanimity even in dense traffic conditions, was a joy..."
"We stayed for 3 days and it was fabulous. Great place for children. There is fish pond with hundreds of them. My boy &amp; niece just love feeding them. Great landscape &amp; fresh air. They recommended good car &amp; driver to explore the city at reasonable price. We were exploring the city up to Baron, Kukup, Krakal beach. Breakfast OK, although some favorite items running out quickly and replacement a bit slow."
"We had 2 club rooms and stayed for 3 nights.  The hotel is a very comfortable base for exploring the sights Yogyakarta has to offer.  We had some long touring days visiting all the attractions including the Dieng Plateau and it was a pleasure to return to the Hyatt Regency each night to be warmly greeted and then enjoy the snacks and drinks on offer in the Regency Club.  While the selection was not large it was adequate and changed nightly.  The rooms were large with a nice view over the gardens.  The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms had all the amenities needed and the free wifi connection in the rooms was strong.  We had breakfast in both the Regency Club and Kemangi Bistro.  When we had an early start we ate in the Regency Club as it was not crowded and quick.  The food</span><span>&hellip;"
"This hotel management puts another pleasant surprise for business travelers.  That surprise being hotel wide WiFi with three apparatus connections per room.  Unlike some of the other hotels in Asia, where WiFi may be limited to certain parts of the hotel, during this trip I was pleasantly surprised to learn that not only can I hook up my iPhone, iPad and Laptop on same account but that a strong signal was available throughout the premises including outside in the pool area.  Good Going Hyatt Yogya."
"Liked the outdoor facilities. Although don&#39;t play golf, the course seemed very nice. Enjoyed chilling around the beautiful pool area. No complaints, whatsoever."
"stayed at this hotel for 2 nights , and we got a big room next to presidential suite on the residence wing. this hotel surrounded by 9-holes golf course with merapi view .  the lounge was  nice and the food were also variety. They also have some pools to enjoy. Restaurant serve local and international food ( buffet ) with reasonable price. the staff was very helpful and always smile . even this location far from the city but this place is suitable for seeking calm , tranquility and relax. for sure will go back again ."
"This is a fabulous hotel.   POSITION - it is a little out of town - not an easy walking distance - but the facilities make up for this. FACILITIES - The space here is wonderful - there are botanical gardens, and 9 hole golf course, 2 interconnected pools (with a fabulous swirling slide for all age groups!) - large enough to feel like a resort, but with the ability to take a short (complimentary) bus ride, or taxi ride, into town. SERVICE - The service was exceptional - very friendly, competent staff (at all levels e.g. manager / waiting / cleaners / gardeners / masseurs).  Above the entrance that the staff use is a sign saying  Smile, you work at the Hyatt - and (because of? despite this?) I always felt that the smiles were genuine and the people genuinely interested. CONCIERGE</span><span>&hellip;"
"The hotel is huge with a beautiful landscaped garden and a 9-hole golf course. Spectacular swimming pool with water slide. Stayed there during Easter holiday. The room is a bit small, but why stay in your room when there is so much to see outside. Have a nice stroll along the fabulous gardens or the Golf course and watch the golf players. I really enjoyed the many activities available at the resort such as cycling along the nearby villages, free traditional horse cart ride and for the kids fishing in the pond near the temple ruins at the lovely garden. On top of that, the food was fantastic and especially the breakfast has a lot of choices and really delicious. They also provide complimentary shuttle to the downtown shopping area which is about 15 minutes away. It was great</span><span>&hellip;"
"Three things that you should consider when you stay there. I have a gold card from Hyatt, so I was upgraded from standard room to Club room, different place to check in, different breakfast room with nicer view, receiving gift and many extra things. The service from the beginning we checked in till we left the hotel was superb, helpful, extra smiles everywhere, extremely polite as most of people from Yogya.    Kids loved the swimming pool, and boys loved playing golf there. So overall it is a great place for enjoying holiday at Yogya.   It&#39;s a bit far from many other places, so you need to take a cab to the center of the city or anywhere else. But I am sure the frontdesk can help you as well with rented car or taxis."
"This is reasonable hotel in Yogjakarta. It has pluses and minuses. Main plus is the large outdoor pool: fantastic for the hot weather and spread over a huge area. Other pluses: friendly staff. Rooms come with a private balcony. Minuses: Rooms/bathrooms are a bit old (definitely need an update), and are kind of small and a tad cramped. Service at the bar is extremely slow. Overall, OK-ish."
We really enjoyed the beautiful grounds of the hotel. The pool was great and our 3 year old love the water slide. Food at the hotel was excellent Concierge was very helpful in arranging and recommending visits to local attractions Hotel even organized excellent baby sitting for her daughter who decided that one temple was more than enough!
"I went to Hyatt Yogya for a business trip. And found this hotel very nice,green,spacious, good landscape. My daughter loved to swim, the swimming pool is great. Breakfast is good . A good place to escape from busy city. Love to be back ."
"stayed with my wive for 4 days in a room with a balcony. view from the balcony was towards the swiming pool, but unfortunately it was blocked by palmtrees leaves. very friendly employees, thanks for a pleasant welcome when i first arrived. clean room and bathroom. the room was not using carpets (me myself prefer a room with carpets). good breakfast. the swimming pool is very exciting, especially the water slide. i&#39;m impressed how the pool was clean considering there&#39;s many trees around the pool.  lucky me my time of arrival was match with valentines day and and a wonderful concert from Java Jive.  a good choice of stay in Jogja with youf family. but unfortunately, the central area of intrest in jogja was quite far from this hotel."
Spent one night at the Hyatt and was quite disappointed...the roomss were basic and tiny....was surprised as to how basic they were for the price we paid...the hotel itself was nice with the golf course etc...but other than that it was sad
"This was a first rtae hotel. good food, great  staff and comfortable rooms. Nearby temples of Borobodur and Prambanan were especailly wonderful. We would rate this hotel as one of the best we have stayed in for many years."
"Nice hotel with v nice architecture, landscape, excellent service and staff. Will stay again on next visit"
"Whether you are visiting Yogya for its hustle and bustle or quiet country side excursion, the hotel is located quite away from city, hence they can afford to make it green, complete with towering mature beringin trees, golf facilities, and good play and lazy pool. Set in a large acreage, the javanese traditional royal architecture and borobudur influence is reflected in the hotel design, a feast to the eyes. Rooms are a bit on the smaller side, though clean, feels a bit tired they can do with a bit of updated. AC somoetimes are not cold enough we found, as we had 4 rooms for our family trip, you just need to ask the engineering dept to attend to it. No balconies except for the gold wing rooms. Plenty of good restaurant along the road."
"I have been a visitor to Yogyakarta for about 8 years now always preferring to stay at Hyatt for its cleanliness, excellent customer service, beautiful grounds.  Over the last two years, I have experienced even more improvement in all these areas.  One issue, I always had was however a lack of fitness center with equipment.  To my delight and pleasant surprise, management has now provided just that, a well equipped fitness center with all the required equipment for a good workout.  To add to it, the center is limited to room guests only eliminating the crowds normally present in hotel fitness centers of local members.  Thanks Hyatt for making my stays more enjoyable.  PS:  the new regulation size pool tables also most certainly make the difference to relax in evenings."
"My advice is to stay at this hotel if you are planning to visit Borobudur temple even though you have a few hours drive to get to the temple.   Do not stay in hotels close to the temple as you will be disappointed as its a bit of a ghost town and nothing else to do there except visit the temple which you can see in a morning. We quickly looked on trip advisor and decided to transfer to The Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta and it was the best move we made! We couldn&#39;t believe we paid the same room rate too. A very relaxing hotel away from the hussle and bussle of the street with friendly staff.  Room was lovely overlooking the garden and palm trees.  Pool was wonderful and a relaxing oasis, with beautiful well kept gardens near by. We enjoyed the Happy hour at the bar next to the golf</span><span>&hellip;"
"We stayed 3 nights in Hyatt Regency over the Chinese New Year break.  We had booked club floor rooms hoping for bigger rooms and good club lounge facilties.  Room size was rather small; and food spread at the 5-7pm cocktail was limited.  Not worth the money.  Plus points were the pool with slides,  Kids loved it.  Spa facilities were good and rather reasonably priced.  Hair spa by Eni - wonderful."
"Hotel is large with public areas well decorated and furnished.  Our room though billed as executive was a standard double having all usual requirements TV, slippers, robes, desk, chairs etc.  It did the job for an overnight stay but nothing special.  The gardens were extensive with pools and a jungly feel plus the golf course.  We were travelling in a group of 30 and had a set menu dinner, which was very good and set in a private pavilion beside the golf course.  Breakfast in the Club lounge was good with attentive staff and chef on hand for cooked dishes."
"The hotel is so huge with beautiful landscaped garden, it has a 9-hole golf course, spectacular swimming pool with water slide and lots of activities for the guests. Stayed there during Xmas holidays, the hotel is full with families on holiday with lots of kids running around  (its the holiday season) but they still deliver high quality service. The room is a bit small but who visited Yogyakarta just to stay in the room, so size is not really a matter to me. Despite other comments stating the hotel is old but for me the gardens &amp; outdoor and the view is timeless and really worth the price. I really enjoyed the many activities available at the resort such as cycling along the nearby villages, free traditional horse cart ride and my kids truly enjoy fishing in the pond near the</span><span>&hellip;"
"We booked high floor, no smoking room and on arrival got a ground floor, smoking room. Not a good start. I am a business traveller and mixing this trip with pleasure. The 9 hole golf course is excellent fun and the hotel grounds are very well kept. The web site advertises a 24 bay driving range which has disappeared under a new condominium! There is NO wifi in the bedrooms!"
"The hotel exterior is very old. Except staffs working in front desk and bell services, the rest seems so strict, they never smile and always talk to each other when they are in the same lift with us. I had a bad experience for my room card. At first it could not open my door, I called and wait for 10 mins until a staff came and gave another card, which is also cant be used. Next day, after breakfast, the card could not open my door again. I called again and no one showed up, I called the second time and nothing happen. Do they expect me to come down to the front desk and talk to them? Luckily, a staff passed by and he tried to help me, he tried so many times, slotted in and out, and finally the door opened! He explained that it was affected by my mobile phone. I&#39;m aware</span><span>&hellip;"
"Room size is moderate, but clean and bright . The baby cot I requested before arrival is not so good, so I ask for a replace. It was done fast by an friendly and efficient staff. Good breakfast buffet with variety and good taste"
"Very good people, uniqe architecture, the best pool in yogyakarta&#39;s hotel"
"I was there in 2009 to visit the ruins of Borobudor, Hyatt is a natural choice for me. Love the properties lush gardens and her surrounding. The building is shaped like a pyramid, you can go to the roof top and take in the view of the surrounding, especially Mount Merapi in the background.  Staff are generally friendly and English is acceptable for this part of Java. The multi-tier swimming pools are really nice and its Salt Water which is a treat from the usual chroline that we are used to. I love the hotel grounds which is filled with pools and lush gardens, just like a Hindu Palace of a long bygone era.  My rooom is basic but with all the necessary supplies, comfy bed and all. Not much to describe.   Buffet dinner is nice with wide selection of indonesian treats. I like the</span><span>&hellip;"
"This was my first time in busy Yogyakarta. The Hyatt provide a perfect relaxing retreat from the chaos of the city. I had one of my best sleeps ever in a hotel. I would definitely stay there again. One of my colleagues had stayed at the Sheraton recently and stated he would take the Hyatt over it.   Pros: Great price at 880,000 IDR (@ $95) Fantastic grounds with lush vegetation, pools and a beautiful golf course Breakfast buffet had almost anything one would want and was included in the room price Super friendly and helpful staff Very quiet rooms with all the essential toiletries provided Numerous English movie and news TV channels Extremely comfortable beds.  Views of the Mount Merapi volcano from the lobby Easy quick check in (with complimentary fruit drink and cool towel) and</span><span>&hellip;"
"plush verdant gardens , immaculate public areas and gracious staff make this hotel very appealing; it is like a gated five star estate and this is can be isolating as coming and going at your leisure isnt the casual affair you&#39;d imagine, what with the tiers of security you have to pass through and the impracticality of strolling outside the hotel compound - but it does have the world&#39;s prettiest jogging track ,excellent food,staff and lagoon pools. The rooms are good - I had a terrace on the ground floor opening out onto the garden, although the bare dull tiled floors could have done with a nice rug to add more comfort and class.A very fine hotel indeed."
"Very nice grounds and pool area.  Staff were very friendly and sweet but English language skills were lacking - made it difficult to get information which I found frustrating.  (English is my first language and I&#39;m normally not snotty about it when visiting another country, but this is a Hyatt.)  Only one plug point in the room which accommodated 2-pin electronics (local PC and recharger).  Access to the health club/ spa/pool is through the restaurant which was very strange.  Sunday brunch was very disappointing.  Bath mats in the spa were grey (formerly white).  Overally, just not very impressive."
"Great hotel, particularly worth to book the club floor with access to lounge. Nice food and wine that is not so easy to get in Java. Pool for kids with long water slide. Fantastic staff."
Everything you would expect from a Hyatt. Staff were charmingand efficient and facilities excellent.
"I first stayed here in 2008 and came back again in early 2011.  As another reviewer said, I wouldn&#39;t stay anywhere else in Yogyakarta.  Great rooms, nice pool and grounds, great service, and in one of my favorite cities.  My fiance also liked it.  The staff really went above and beyond to make us comfortable, to include lovely touches at turndown- local sweets and a little leaf with &quot;sweet dream&quot; painted on it placed on our bed.  Our room had a little balcony out onto the garden (1st floor) but we had an amazing amount of privacy.  The breakfast buffet was excellent.  I stayed here the first time with my mother and it is still her favorite hotel."
"We stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights and 5 days and have only just returned.  We stayed in a club room and enjoyed the free drinks in the evenings but had breakfast in the main restaurant as there are no cooked breakfasts in the club.  Breakfast in the main restaurant was great, as were the other meals we ate there. The Hyatt is a beautiful hotel with stunning gardens and a beautiful 9 hole golf course.  The resort is very spacious as is the area around the lagoon style swimming pool.  It was a very restful place to return to after a hard days&#39; touring or shopping.  It is not in the centre of town but we found that was not a problem at all. The staff were great - always extremely helpful, especially the front desk staff. Our rooms were lovely and were on the ground floor with</span><span>&hellip;"
"We had an amazing and relaxing stay at this property; the team members and their services were amazing. Highly recommend to book a higher category with club access; the room was very clean, the breakfast at the club sumptuous and delicious. Would return any time again; the dinner show was a great addition to our stay experience, and Borobudur in proximity for an exciting day tour. The golf course was in a top-notch condition, and every employee greeted us friendly with a smile!"
"Stayed for 3 nights in a King Room and was overall very happy with the room and quality of services. Although I&#39;m quite certain the room is smaller than 30m2 (as stated in website), the ambience is cozy and comfortable. Loved the bed and pillows, and linen is very clean. All the furniture are well kept. I especially appreciated the small yet thoughtful amenities, such as anti-slip bathtub mat, fresh flowers (in the bathroom and on study desk), and the daily complimentary fruits. Daily housekeeping is also immaculate.   The hotel boasts lush and leafy surroundings. The only 5-star hotel in Yogyakarta (if I&#39;m not mistaken) to have a golf course and view of Mount Merapi. Pool is also lovely, but the fitness centre was being refurbished hence non-operational. Complimentary fitness</span><span>&hellip;"
"Great hotel. Expected it to be a business hotel but pleasantly surprised to see a resort style concept. The ambience was great, perfect for relaxing. Hotel facilities were excellent with a large pool area and other recreation such as a 9 hole golf course (lot of par 3&#39;s though 6/9) and was in close proximity to ancient must see sites like borobodur etc. Overall I enjoyed my stay here although priced a little high and would definitely revisit the same hotel. Service was excellent. Only criticism would be to have a wider selection of western food on the buffets. Had a great holiday!"
"It was my second visit to Yogyakarta. I really love this hotel as you get very personalized service and attention from the staffs. They address you by name most of the time. We really like the pool, it was so nice and relaxing. The landscaping in the hotel vicinity was great. We are avid golfers, so we played two rounds of 9. The course was rather well kept.  We also enjoyed the spa! After the first try on the first day, we had spa for the next two days too! One thing I really like about this hotel is that staffs were trained to wear a smile all the time!"
"We stayed here three nights and left feeling very sad. This is absolutely a five star hotel. We were quite surprised bing told that the hotel was 100 meters away, while cruising on a rather busy road, but we found paradise around the corner.  After a nice welcome in the great lobby, we were brought to our rooms. Nice, but rather small. But this hotel is not about the rooms, but all about the garden. Hyatt designed a magnificent pool, full with cosy corners, bridges and slides. Absolute highlight is the 70 meter long temple waterslide that kept our children busy for hours. Also great was the fact that the children were encouraged to fish in the pond (Hyatt provides gear). We felt sorry for ourselves that we don&#39;t play golf, as the golf course looked wonderful, with the lush green</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed at the Hyatt recency for two nights - 12-12 August 2011.  The reservation was expertly and courteously handled.  On arrival, I was treated like royalty, complete with a Jasmine garland.  The room I syayed is spacious and tsatefully furnished.  The surrounds had a serene, tropical, home-away-from-home feel to it.  Staff were very courteous and professional.  The catering service was flawless and the meals exceeded my expectations in quality and variety.  A free shuttle service is available at very convenient periods to and from the city  I would certainly return to this lovely hotel when next I&#39;m in Yokja!"
"Those reviews that have commented that this hotel is simply an average hotel with very nice and helpful staff, lovely gardens and setting but with small dated rooms and pretty average to poor food are pretty much spot on in our opinion.   Here you pretty much get what you pay for. Over delivered to some extent by a very pleasant and helpful staff who are always ready to help if not always totally competent.   Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel but just realize it will not be a wow experience and the food below average."
"I have been a guest at this particular hotel for over 7 years on a regular basis. I frequent this hotel in spite of other International chains for 1/2 or 60% of the price for one reason only =&gt; Service. To my great surprise the service continues to improve when I think there is no room for improvement. For the last two years, the service has been way over the top and the grounds are looking prettier and cleaner.   Breakfast It is very rare that in a 5 star hotel, the chef goes out of his way to change the menu to satisfy the customer on his own. That is a hotel where the Chef comes out and asks you if there is anything that can be cooked to your liking. Chef Chatur in Hyatt Regency does that and then even in his absence on subsequent visits to the restaurant the staff is aware</span><span>&hellip;"
"Opened in 1997, but hasn&#39;t dated.¬†  Pros: Flower garland (and drink) on arrival! Friendly English-speaking Reception staff. All staff friendly, smiley and very helpful.¬† Free &#39;Malioboro Shuttle&#39; bus to/from¬†Malioboro Street (9am onwards from hotel) in¬†Yogyakarta¬†for handicrafts and Batik and the city centre.¬†¬†See Reception for travel times.¬† Spacious room with ensuite bath-shower, hairdryer, fridge, multi-channel TV (incl BBC World, CNN, ESPN, Eurosport, Star Sports, HBO, MTV Asia, Discovery Channel), tea/coffee making facilities, electronic safe, writing desk (containing pen, paper, envelopes and pocket-sized¬†Yogyakarta city map/hotel map). Extensive well-maintained gardens with variety of trees, plants &amp; shrubs and exotic fish surrounding the hotel, immaculate 9 hole golf</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed for 4 nights conference. Well, its quite far from the airport and there&#39;s not much around the hotel. The food in the hotel is quite good but I also went out for dinner sometimes. There&#39;s a good seafood restaurant about 10&#39; by taxi. I cant recall the local name as its too difficult in Bahasa to remember. You can ask the hotel anytime as it gas close relation to the hotel. The room is ok but I had a room with a faulty toilet. After few calls, they fixed it. However, it it was well managed, the hotel should know it in advance. The conference facility is also good that i have no complaint. The frony desk service is nice but i didnt have more complaint eithet ad we were serviced by a separate event organizer, not the hotel"
"We stay here for 4 days and enjoyed a great five star hotel with excellent service.  Internet rates are too high (USD 15) and rooms are rather small, but the nice hotel staff provide a very enjoyable stay. The tour organization (none Hyatt organization) was very good, too. We would go to this hotel again, if we come ever back."
"Just love the cosy and comfy feeling ambiance of the hotel, be it in the lobby or the rooms. Authentic Javanese interior deco..Staffs were ever helpful and friendly. There are wide varieties of spread for b&#39;fast. Scenery within the hotel surroundings were superbly magnificent and lovely whereby you can view afar the Mount Merapi Mountain from the hotel. Majority of the visitors were expat travelers. For those who love to be in a rather &#39;posh&#39; place, may try out Hyatt but as for location, it is not a walking distance to any shopping areas. You must have a transport to bring you around unless you are really really familiar with the area..."
"Stayed here for a night after 2 nights stay at the Sheraton Yogyakarta I thought I would have an interesting experience for a change. Indeed I had a very interesting or I would say a not so pleasant experience here at the Hyatt. I came to the hotel at about 10 PM after a whole day trip to Borobudur and its surrounding places. The check in process took about 15 minutes for me to actually got the key in my hand. It was a bit slow process especially because I came there after 10 PM and no one else was checking in. The room itself was definetely deserved a major renovation. Furniture was so old and many of them had cigarette burns all over. Room size was about 3/4 of those standard rooms at the Sheraton. However, Hyatt&#39;s price was about $ 10 higher than Sheraton&#39;s. for the value of</span><span>&hellip;"
"Recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta while there for a few days of business. The first thing that you notice about this property is that it is an oasis in an otherwise unremarkable neighborhood.  The grounds are lovely, and the rooms comfortable. Staff are very attentive, and extremely polite.  Had a few meals at the hotel while there and they were fine. For the newcomer to Indonesia, a meal is not a &quot;meal&quot; unless it includes rice - try the Nasi Goreng.  Spa services (reflexology, massage) are attractively priced, but the big disappointment  is that there is not a fitness center on the property. There is a pool, but it is a play pool, complete with water slide, but not a swimming pool. There also is a nine-hole golf course on the premises.  Arranged through the hotel</span><span>&hellip;"
"The general feeling is good, but there are pros and cons to consider.  Pros  The staff is very good and they go out of their way to help you. Many examples.  The garden is beautiful.  Evening buffet is delicious.  Cons  Breakfast is mainly inedible.  Rooms are very small.  Bathroom cleanliness is hardly acceptable.  However, considering the price tag, the hotel has good value."
"The experience of staying at this hotel should not be missed - the hotel building itself is beautiful and based on the Borobudur Temple, but what makes this hotel so fantastic is the staff who go out of their way to help you.  They are always smiling and greet you by your name (how can they remember all the guests names??)  The extra touches were lovely - the complimentary breakfast boxes for us to take to the airport due to our early departure, the call 10 minutes after we arrived to the room checking everything was in order, the flower necklaces on arrival, the Ramayana Ballet performed at the hotel on Saturday nights, the complimentary horse and carriage ride (which our young son loved), the follow up personalised email thanking us for our stay the day after we arrived home</span><span>&hellip;"
"My stay was amazing!  My room was spacious and very nice, as was the bathroom.  The grounds were beautiful.  Buffet breakfast had a really wide choice.  Staff were incredibly friendly and were very quick to help with all of my queries."
"Long journey to the hotel, first impression lovely, walking past fish ponds. Very grand looking place designed to look like a temple. The gardens are designed in the same way.  Our room, although we upgraded, was not unlike any other room we have stayed in without upgrading. Not unpleasant though. The evening when we arrived there was a buffet and dancing, for which we paid ¬£40.  No-one was there to suggest we tried things to to explain what food stuff&#39;s we were eating.  It began to rain and unknown to us the deserts and fresh fruit were moved inside.  We ate very little and missed out on the fruit because no-one told us it had moved. The next night we ate in the restaurant, ¬£60 and the food was not at all good.  The service was not good either.  It&#39;s too big and had few guests</span><span>&hellip;"
"Its taken me a bit of time to write up this review. I took a holiday with my family and we stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Yogyakarta  In one word, our experience was outstanding  What made it spectacularly so was the great service at the hotel. While I&#39;d like to single out Erwin Rachman (Front Office Manager) for exceptional service, every single staff member was great  My Diamond upgrade to a Suite was honored swiftly and with a large smile (unlike the reluctant posturing one sometimes faces)  The suite was large and very comfortable. It was at the ground level and opened to a lush garden. The bed like the room was very large and comfortable. The bathroom was nice and everything worked well. This was one well maintained resort and felt more like a Grand Hyatt rather than a</span><span>&hellip;"
The hotel does not deserve to be a Hyatt. We stayed two nights and this was a real disappointment. We stayed on points and our rooms was really small and old. Bed was not confortable at all. It seems lots of groups are staying there with all the downs it brings. Restaurant terrace was privatized one evening and the next evening I ruined expensive pants on dirty greasy chair. They are lucky to be located in a very touristic part of Java but I would recommend to stay somewhere else even if it is more expensive.
The Hyatt Regency is a nice and clean resort. The gardens are very beautifull. Also the food is very nice. If we stay in Yogya ever again we will stay here again.
"i went here with my office&#39;s friend and family for an office outing. the hotel is great,,,nice...the lobby looks so elegant,,,but the most liked think is the pool....we&#39;ve been arranged for some fun games there....like the pool very much...there is a salt waterpool,, ... however, i kind of dislike the location...it&#39;s far from everywhere...must take taxi to go to malioboro..but again, the hotel is cool"
"Booked through Hyatt website and arranging all the necessary with Hyatt from airport pick up, chauffer driven sightseeing and spa.  Took a direct flight from SG to their Adisucipto airport and was pick up promptly by our driver - Ahmad.  Arrived at the hotel and was greeted warmly with jasmine garlands , cold towels and pink guava juice.  Reception arranged our two rooms to be ready and we had lunch while waiting.  Though limited F&amp;B outlets, their services were immaculate.  Rooms given was connecting ones for our young ones.  Stayed for four nights and did not regret choosing Hyatt even though it is quite a distance from town (taxi about Rp 30,000 one way).  Here are the pros and cons for this hotel.  Will definitely come back again.  Pros 1) Staff are polite, attentive and</span><span>&hellip;"
"We spent 5 nights at the Hyatt. We chose the Regency Club  Floor because with a full American breakfast, coctails and appetizers the rate at least as a senior (over 62) was both convenient and a bargain. The service as a regency Club guest was excellent but it appeared that was they way all guestsere treated. Though the hotel was lovely we were out with our guide by 8 AM and back at 5:30-6  so we did not use the hotel facilities though they were all available. In fact most evenings the appetizers in the Club Lounge were good so we enjoyed enough with a glass or two of wine that we ordered a pizza in the room 2 nights because we were so tired and none of the good restaurants around or in town have A/C and even at 8 PM it is 83-84 and 65+% humidity and that is not comfortable for</span><span>&hellip;"
Absolutely stunning...a perfect place to unwind and relax
"Great place to stay if you are visiting and exploring the area and want some confort in your stay.   Great pool and general layout of the hotel. You could say that the extreme pool is a little tacky with water slides through imitation buddhist temple ruins, but the general theme of structures linked to Borbudur does work well with beautiful gardens and landscaping.  Reception staff were great.  Spa service was great- had a real nice massage.   Food was genrally great. Breakfast was a little disappointing, wasn&#39;t real fresh and some limited choices. Bar was nice, good choice, limited wine selection but no different to much of Java.  Only draw back was distance to Yogya town area. Taxi was easily arranged and cost effective to town.  Concierge staff were helpful, friendly full of</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed here for 4 nights during a Yogyakarta visit. The positives-- Love the grounds and pool area and welcome greeting with a leigh of gardenias. Great place for kids, with a couple of slides.  Wonderful foliage and multiple pools.  Nice walking path alongside the golf course. Had a good haircut for $8.  Meals are reasonable.  Gift shop has quality items at reasonable prices. Nice rooms and clean. The negatives-- Limited dining options close by outside the hotel, other than a great restaurant next door. The Hyatt is somewhat far from the central activities of Yogyakarta. Stayed in a club room and the breakfast/evening appetizer selection is poor quality compred to most Hyatt properties.  Also a very short cocktail hour. No gym. They are very picky about which dollar bills they</span><span>&hellip;"
"This was the second time we visited Yojakarta. The first time, a few years ago, we chose to stay at the Melia Purosani because of its location downtown, but because recent reviews described it as run down we decided on the Hyatt. Ours was a Club room, not too big but  comfortable with quite a large bathroom, the view on the golf course was pleasant. There were no bathrobes and no slippers, something inconsistent given the Club level. Breakfast and evening cocktails were served in the Club dining room, it was surprising to find out that one could eat breakfast ONLY in the Club dining room , not anywhere else in the hotel which we found quite limiting, anyway the food spread was reasonable.  We dined and lunched in the hotel a few times. The menu was average and prices acceptable,</span><span>&hellip;"
"If you&#39;re travelling independently and need a little bit of comfort, then this place is a pretty good option. When we were there the pool area was pretty much empty during the day &amp; it was a great place to relax and enjoy the sun. The tour groups seemed to pass through every couple of days but were only around for dinner and breakfast before heading off again. You&#39;re also really well located for both Borobudor and Prambanan - both well worth visiting (though $12 to enter Prambanan feels a little steep). The hotel itself is nice enough, food is good - though probably lacks options if you&#39;re staying more than a couple of nights. We had a room with a decent sized balcony which was nice for dining outside."
"It is a nice little Regency hotel with captivating Golf grounds. So, the key is that you need to book the rooms with a Golf view in a higher floor, which is the 6th and 7th floor. Standard rooms , but still well laid out, atleast much better then hyatt Sanur standard room. The breakfast is a nice spread and the swimming pool and garden are splendid. The hotel also has a very nice lounge, where you can sit and gaze the mountains and read a book and the kids play with the fishes. Overall, hotel is well recommended."
The hotel is very well built and rooms are comfortable
"Stayed four nights at the Hyatt while touring the UNESCO sites(which rank among the most impressive Hindu and Buddhist ruins anywhere in the world). The hotel is a 15 minute tax ride($3)from downtown but my wife and I welcomed the serenity and quiet after battling through persistent batik hawkers and the oppressive heat at the ruins. The huge swimming pool is a DREAM to use in the 35+ degree heat.  Room, staff and service were faultless during our stay and overall the Hyatt ranked as one of the top two or three hotels we stayed at during our month long tour through Indonesia, Malaysia and Borneo. We stayed just as low season was starting so felt like we had the place to ourselves; the Sunday brunch and Saturday night cultural dance and ballet performance may as well been custom</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed at the hotel just 2 months ago. Good things to note: Front desk was patient and approachable as I changed my rooms twice because of the unsatisfactory view. They also gave very good suggestions on places to dine. Offerings at tour desk was good and explanation was very clear. Prices were also reasonable and surprisingly cheaper than the random tour agencies in town. Liked the shuttle service to town which enable us to enjoy shopping and dining at any time of the day.   What can be improved: Spa. Despite telling the therapist that I would prefer a harder massage, the massage was still too light for my liking. Will need service staff to attend to jacuzzi and sauna area. I had to switch on the sauna and adjust the temperature myself! Jacuzzi was also not switched on and it</span><span>&hellip;"
"we have stayed here for three nights in order to see many historical sites in the area. This hotel was a great refugium after whole day sightseeing, especially as weather was changing reaching high temperatures and humidity. To come back was like to return to an oasis of quiteness, comfort and beauty.  Hotel is well kept with beautiful gardens, pool area and golf course. Very nice is also the lobby area- The open air part with walkways to the pool and spa area give you never the feeling you are in huge chain hotel.  We have had very cheap and good spa treatments in hotel spa every day, as well very tasty food in hotel restaurant. There are two eateries in place, but with same menu as there is only one kitchen... Breakfast in main restaurant has wide and good choice, the one in</span><span>&hellip;"
"Amazing hotel in the city.  Only a 10-15 min walk away from the night market.  Staff were extremely friendly, polite and helpful.  Good bufftet breakfast (be sure to ask for your breakfast to packed the day before if you are heading out before the buffet breakfast is ready).  Fantastic value for money, 4 of us stayed in 2 rooms for 2 nights for only SGD $360 through asiarooms.com.    The only negatives about this place is the shower temperature was not consistent, it would run from lukewarm to hot and then cold ... also you might placed in room which faces the mosque speakers ... could be a problem for those who are light sleepers."
"I stayed for two nights at the Hyatt Regency on business. The grounds are wide and beautiful, and the public areas are spacious. The staff are very polite, efficient, and proficient in English. The hotel is generous with little things such as good, thick face tissue, adult- sized bars of soap, and plenty of bottles of drinking water. I was surprised to find the buffet dinner quite a good deal and quite tasty.  Likewise, the hotel tariff extended to embassies was very reasonable.  On the minus side, it costs about 35 cents a minute for LAN Internet connection up to a maximum of $15 per 24-hour period, which seemed steep for those without expense accounts but understandable considering that the Hyatt has a monopoly, far from Internet cafes.  By comparison, I understand the Mercure</span><span>&hellip;"
very good hotel  amazing service  golf is great  spa fantastic  food really nice
"It was our first experience spending the nights in this lovely cultural city in Central Java and it was a perfect hotel to spend my stay there.  All staff starting from Bell Boy, Security Guard, Pool Boy, everyone I must say was Excellent !!! I never found hotel staff that more courteous, attentive, friendly than those I met in Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta.  They did an Excellent Maintenance of hotel premises and facilities,especially those hard working Pool Staff; even though, as some of reviewer mentioned that room furniture a bit tattered, I won&#39;t say it was worse, it still lovely &amp; well maintained.  Watched a Fantastic Jatilan and Ramayana Dance; too bad it was raining; if not, it would be showcased around Pool Stage area and we would be dining under the stars with Fantastic Set</span><span>&hellip;"
"We had a short stay here right after our stay at the Amanjiwo.  A bit of anti-climax was to be expected.  However I felt the hotel provided very good value, especially since I had used my Hyatt points (lowest category) for the free room.  The hotel is a bit dated but the architectural style is still interesting, as it reflects that of Borobudour.  The biggest draw for me is the large garden surrounding the hotel.  It was really nice to be able to have a nice stroll around, and you can even play a bit of golf.    A good place to stay in Yogya."
"After a disappointing night at the Melia Purosani, I decided to check out and stay at the Hyatt in Yogjakarta. Here I spent three nights and absolutely loved the hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, but the surroundings are just gorgious. The swimming pool has different parts and is great for kids as well. I&#39;m a young woman myself and travelled to Java alone for business, yet felt completely comfortable at the Hyatt. It&#39;s a great place to unwind. The spa is good, but the one at the Grand Mercure is much better. There are many rather large groups of professionals travelling to the Hyatt, but when I visited they didn&#39;t bother me much. Could imagine it may be annoying in the high season, though. TIP: booking through AsiaRooms gives you great discount on prices!"
"We stayed at the Hyatt Yogjakarta for 4 nights having booked through Asia Rooms at the rate of 49 ‚Ç¨ a night including breakfast. We loved the hotel gardens and swimming pool area which are beautiful.  Rooms are nice, but smaller than expected in a Hyatt. The real problem was noise. It seems the hotel gives priority to groups vs individual travellers. There was an Indosat group staying at the same time as we did. One morning, loud music in the gardens started at 5.30 am. Impossible to sleep, and a call at reception did not help.  The New Zealand prime minister also stayed at the hotel when we were there ... that meant police &amp; military people everywhere, which gave a strange feeling while relaxing at the swimming pool ;-) All together, although the price was very good, I am not</span><span>&hellip;"
"Stayed in Hyatt Yogyakarta for 3 nights for a regional office meeting.   A fabulous hotel with a traditional javanese  style terrace lobby, located about 15 minutes from Yogya&#39;s city center. I&#39;m not a golfer, but I bet those who play would be estatic to see the course they have.   Check in was efficient, staff were very-very friendly. The hotel as a great swimming pool and a health club where you can have a sauna but no gymn. But that club is a bit crowded from golfers trying to relax their muscles. There is also a jogging track around the hotel.  Room was very clean, great view of the golf course. You even can see Mount Merapi in the clear morning sky.  Pillow was bit too tough for my neck. High speed internet is about 30c/min but you can do a straight 24 hours surf for about</span><span>&hellip;"
"Hyatt Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia  First contact: Upon arrival in Yogyakarta we were picked up by the taxi-service organised by the hotel at a rate of 9 USD after calling the day before. The courteous staff brought us to the premises in around 20 minutes time.  Exterior/Interior: The hotel itself is located very nicely, you plunge into  the central-Javanese tropics and immediately get the feeling of having booked yourself into a small but fine resort. The exterior is in good shape, I think the hotel has been refurbished recently, and does not show any sign of the recent earthquake wreckages.  When entering you can, provided you have clear sight, see Gunung Merapi right in front of you. A great view surrounded by the well taken care of golf-course beneath this active volcano. </span><span>&hellip;"
"This is a beautifully designed hotel with attractive grounds and a fantastic swimming pool. Staff are charming and reasonably efficient - they even laid on a surprise cake for my birthday! However there were three drawbacks in an otherwise enjoyable stay: 1) There is an extraordinary lack of sound-proofing. The noise from the next door rooms (television and conversation) and from the room above (frequent furniture moving - why did they have to do that?) was terrible. We were woken at a very early hour as a result (5am one morning). Our room no. was 523 but I think that this may apply in other rooms. 2) Check-in and out were slow due to a lack of staff on duty at those times. 3) The location is a bit far out of town, although they did offer a free shuttle service into town</span><span>&hellip;"
"I stayed at this hotel for a week.  The staff is nice.  The rooms are average-small with no real difference between the room status.  Beds are comfortable with nice pillows.  Bathrooms have a small bathtub, no drawers to hold personal items...standard shampoo, bath gels, etc.    The food service-both restaurant and room service is average to below average.  Breakfast buffet is adequate but meager in offerings and quality. Staff spends more time cleaning and organizing then taking care of the diners-often have to wave someone down to get service.  English skills are mostly low with the staff...so you have to often repeat yourself or not get a desired result.  I&#39;m fully aware that we are in Indonesia but just something to be aware of.  In the outdoor lounge area, we sat for over</span><span>&hellip;"
